# Third party licenses

OSCAL-XProc relies on these open-source software packages:

- [MorganaXProcIII](https://www.xml-project.com/morganaxproc-iiise.html) from [&lt;xml-project />](https://www.xml-project.com)
- Saxon 12 from [Saxonica](https://www.saxonica.com/)
- [SchXSLT](https://github.com/schxslt/schxslt) by David Maus, a Schematron implementation
- Their dependencies, including Java.

After installation as described in the [README](README.md), see the `lib` directory for these distributions and their license files.

Licenses bearing on Morgana are in its [licenses](lib/MorganaXProc-IIIse-1.3.7/licences/) folder (GPL3 and other licenses).

Saxon licenses are in the [zip file distribution for Saxon](lib/SaxonHE12-3J.zip) in the `notices` folder - `LICENSE.txt` and neighbor files.

The license for SchXSLT is at the top level of its distribution.

Additionally to these, further details on licensing will be given in any projects that rely similarly on downloaded resources.

Note that these libraries are not available from the project repository; the utility `setup.sh`, or pipelines designed for the purpose, can be run to acquire them.
