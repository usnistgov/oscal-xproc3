        <p>This chapter provides a deliberate and logical framework to support Army leaders developing themselves and others. These activities follow the same organization as the leader attributes and competencies found in the Army leadership requirements model (see ADP 6-22), to help individuals identify and prioritize which leader requirements to target for growth. The developmental activity tables follow a standard format: strength and need indicators, underlying causes, and recommended options to initiate action. The indicators provide ways to understand leader actions and confirm aspects of each leader behavior as a strength or a developmental need. The underlying causes provide more information on what the root cause may be for a developmental need. The tables provide three options for developmental action: feedback, study, and practice</p>
      </part>
      <part name="enumeration" id="part-4-2">
        <prop name="label" value="4-2."/>
        <p>To best use this chapter’s information, one identifies the competency and attribute behaviors for developmental focus. An individual may already have an IDP that documents goals and a plan for development or have an idea of what leadership competency or skill to develop. A coach, rater, counselor, or mentor can use this material to help focus leaders or subordinates on specific developmental goals and prepare for growth counseling. Different sources and events inform the process to identify developmental goals for competencies and behaviors as illustrated in <a href="#table4_1">table 4-1</a>.</p>

          <p>When considering learning and developmental activities, some automatically think about taking a formal training course or reading. While these may be helpful, leaders are encouraged to select developmental activities that fit with personal preferences and situation. It is important to think through personal and career goals when deciding on a developmental activity.</p>

      <part name="enumeration" id="part-4-3">
        <prop name="label" value="4-3."/>
        <p>After identifying a developmental focus, refer to the Army leadership requirements model and the leader developmental tables to evaluate the leader capabilities associated with the selected competency or attribute. Each section is designed to help a leader act on strengths as well as developmental needs. Some may experience greater growth by focusing on improving strengths rather than focusing on developmental needs or using strengths to address developmental needs.</p>

        <part name="enumeration" id="part-4-4">
          <prop name="label" value="4-4."/>
          <p>Evaluating capabilities involves identifying personal practices that support or hinder successful performance. Each table includes diagnostics to enable evaluating how well someone is doing on that behavior and provides examples of why they may or may not be excelling. Consider if the strength and need indicators represent personal behaviors. Be aware of counterproductive leadership behaviors. Many leaders are aware of such behaviors but choose to overlook or condone them to achieve short-term results, but oftentimes some leaders may not even realize they display such behaviors. Each diagnostic section includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Strength Indicators: Behaviors and actions that contribute to or support successful performance.</p>

            <li>
              <p>Need Indicators: Behaviors and actions that reduce or hinder successful performance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Underlying Causes: Examples why someone may not excel at a particular leader behavior.</p>

        <p>Within the leadership requirements model, competencies are skills that leaders can train and develop while attributes encompass enduring personal characteristics molded through experience over time. Applying the if-then logic in <a href="#table4_3">table 4-3</a> to each developmental goal helps maximize development efforts. For greater understanding to direct development, first seek feedback and follow with study and practice. If a developmental need is known but how to address that need is unknown, start with study and follow with practice. If the only unknown is what to practice, then focus on the practice activities.</p>

        <p>View all suggestions for developmental activities through a personal lens. The following questions are sample questions to ask when refining a development activity to fit personal needs and situation. Depending on the chosen activity, other considerations may be important too. Be willing to take risks and choose activities outside personal comfort zones to challenge yourself and accelerate development.</p>
        <part name="boxed">
          <title>Determining Developmental Activities</title>
          <p>Answer these to select appropriate developmental activities:</p>

        <p>Use tables <a href="#table4_4">4-4</a> and <a href="#table4_5">4-5</a>  to locate appropriate developmental activities. Leader 180 and Leader 360 feedback reports detail individual or unit strengths and developmental needs. Learners and coaches select a few actions at a time to guide development. Additionally, these reports inform leaders of any counterproductive leadership behaviors others have observed in them.</p>

          <title>Employing Leadership Requirements Model Developmental Activities</title>
          <p>CPT Kenny and 1SG Mac are briefing LTC Day on an upcoming team live fire exercise. At the end, LTC Day asks what competencies or attributes from the leadership requirements model they are targeting with the training event. Neither could answer the question.</p>
          <p>LTC Day: “Gentlemen, your plan is sound, and the outcome will be trained teams ready to move into greater collective training, but we are missing an opportunity to develop our leaders here. Training without thought of the LRM is like an unguided missile, it gets the job done, but we owe it to our subordinate leaders to be precise. Don’t let leader development just happen, be deliberate and actively plan for it.”</p>
          <p>CPT Kenny and 1SG Mac return to their office to discuss what LTC Day said.</p>
          <p>CPT Kenny: “I understand what LTC Day said, and I know our leaders need some work. We have both worked with them on their IDPs. Several things almost derailed our individual training leading up to this, mostly centered on communication. What should we do to focus on that?”</p>
          <p>1SG Mac: “We wanted to get better tactically, but maybe we should have been more specific. We know what we want to improve, we just didn’t select competencies to work on. Perhaps we can alter our training scenarios to deliberately target communication between leaders.”</p>
          <p>After NTC, the OC/T, CPT Smole, is conducting the final AAR with the company. CPT Smole: “Let me begin by saying that it was truly a pleasure to watch this company operate during this rotation. You clearly put emphasis on communication during training because everyone was on the same common operating picture from the command team to the lowest private and it showed in how well you adjusted to changes in the plan.…”</p>
          <part name="quoted">
            <p>I never would have thought that I could design training that would deliberately develop attributes or competencies without LTC Day asking the right questions. Nor would I have thought that it would work. Once we figured it out though, we incorporated it into everything we did and every leader could always tell me what the training objective, and developmental objective, for every event was. I had no greater pleasure as a company commander than deliberately developing my subordinates and watching them progress into great leaders in their own right.</p>

        <p>Soldiers and DA Civilians enter the Army with personal values developed in childhood and nurtured over years of personal experience. By taking an oath to serve the Nation and the Army, one agrees to live and act by the Army Values. Adherence and dedication to the Army Values reflect character. The Army Values consist of the principles, standards, and qualities considered essential for successful Army leaders. To develop character in others, leaders must embody the Army Values. The Army Values are fundamental to Soldiers and DA Civilians making the right decision in any situation. Teaching values is an important leader responsibility that creates a common understanding of the Army Values and expected standards. Leaders must communicate expectations that others embody the Army Values as well. Reinforcing ethical standards increases the likelihood of ethical decisions and actions and promotes an ethical climate.</p>

        <p>Empathy is defined as the ability to share and understand someone else’s feelings. The capacity for empathy is an important attribute for leaders to possess. Empathy can allow leaders to understand how their actions affect others. The ability to see something from another person’s viewpoint, to identify with, and enter into another person’s feelings and emotions, enables the Army leader to better interact with others.</p>

        <p>Army leaders show empathy when they genuinely relate to another person’s situation, motives, and feelings. Empathy does not necessarily mean sympathy, but identification leading to a deeper understanding.

        <p>Leaders with a capacity for empathy can apply it to understanding and anticipating the reactions of DA Civilians, Soldiers and their Families, and local populations. Empathy helps a leader take care of Soldiers and others and demonstrate respect. Army leaders take care of Soldiers and DA Civilians by giving them the training, equipment and support needed to accomplish the mission. They value balance between mission requirements and the welfare of their followers. It improves morale, climate, decision-making, and readiness. The attribute empathy has one component: Identify with another person’s feelings and emotions.</p>

DA Civilians, while not warfighters, embody the Warrior Ethos principles through a service ethos that integrates their conduct of duty with the same attitudes, beliefs, and commitment. The Warrior Ethos is developed and sustained through discipline, commitment to the Army Values, and pride in the Army’s heritage.

        <p>Discipline is a mindset for a unit or an organization to practice sustained, systematic actions to reach and promote a capability to perform its military function. Often this involves attending to organization and administration details, which are less urgent than an organization's key tasks, but necessary for efficiency and long-term effectiveness. Making the right choices involves discipline. Discipline is a reinforcing function to character. Self-discipline is everyone’s responsibility, while leaders also are responsible for unit discipline. Development relies on self-discipline to put others’ needs ahead of personal comfort and desires. The attribute discipline has a single component: Control personal behavior.</p>

        <p>Humility, as an attribute of an Army leader’s character, is the absence of arrogance. To be a leader, one must be confident and competent. Effective leaders temper confidence with humility. However, it is often difficult to judge one’s own humility. Humility is a subjective perception based on a leader’s behaviors and interpretations differ based on cultural or gender context. The attribute humility has one component: Seek feedback and explore personal performance (see <a href="#table4_12">table 4-12</a>).</p>
      </part>
      <part name="enumeration" id="part-4-24">
        <prop name="label" value="4-24."/>
        <p>Humility exists on a continuum. Effective leaders exhibit an appropriate degree of humility. Others view a leader who expresses excess humility as being meek, timid, or overly passive. Conversely, others consider a leader who expresses too little humility as overconfident or arrogant. A leader lacking self- confidence may feel the need to hide any perception of weakness and may display arrogant behavior as a result while a self-confident individual is free to demonstrate humility. A leader who expresses too much or too little humility lacks self-awareness. This, in turn undermines confidence in the leader’s ability to make good decisions and achieve success.</p>

        <p>Mental agility is a flexibility of mind that allows leaders to adapt to uncertain or changing situations. Agility allows leaders to anticipate changing situations and think through second- and third-order effects. Mentally agile leaders develop and implement alternative approaches when current actions are not producing the desired results. Adaptation involves knowing or deciding whether to adapt, what to adapt to, over what timeframe to adapt, and how to adapt. Adaptability is enabled by—</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Recognizing the need for change or recognize a need to act.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Knowing the cues that point to real, meaningful differences and cause-effect relationships.</p>

          <li>
            <p>Having flexible knowledge triggered from different cues. Useful knowledge is likely structured in modular chunks that can recombine in new ways. Understanding the principles and theory behind facts contributes to applying knowledge in novel ways. This characteristic is cognitive flexibility.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Seeing multiple sides of an issue and a drive to work toward the best one. Often, multiple sides need integration to derive the best perspective. Openness, seeing opposites, selecting the best of opposing approaches, designing compromise, or resolving contradictions aid integration.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Thinking in reverse time. This involves being able to think from a desired end state through the prior steps that reach it. It may involve going from constraints or possibilities to figure what is doable, what are plausible goals.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Handling multiple lines of thought. Involves tracking numerous issues or questions, prioritizing among them, remembering lesser issues while maintaining an overarching perspective, and returning to think about lesser issues when time is available.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Changing perspective. Referred to as decentering, this involves an ability to move away from one's center or viewpoint to overcome thinking obstacles and blind spots.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Thinking in progressively deeper ways. Involves thinking at the right level of depth and breadth that optimize effort on thinking to match the gravity of the situation.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Predicting. Involves going beyond first-order or obvious meaning, to broaden thinking to future classes of situations.</p>
          </li>

            <p>Visualizing and conceptualizing. Involves ability to imagine complex or unusual relationships, possibilities, or unforeseen consequences and relationships.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Thinking holistically. Involves seeing wholes, sets of relationships and interactions, instead of analytical, decomposed, individual, or isolated parts. Relates to an ability to "see" in dynamics— moving pictures—instead of a static snapshot.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Mentally simulating what could happen. Mental simulation is mentally constructing and thinking through a model of a problem, situation, or potential solution to determine important relationships.

Specific techniques for influence fall along a continuum including pressure, legitimate requests, exchange, personal appeals, collaboration, rational persuasion, apprising, inspiration, participation, and relationship building (see ADP 6-22 for more information). To succeed in creating true commitment, leaders determine the proper influence technique based on the situation and individuals involved. Keep in mind that the influence effects are not often instantaneous. It may take time before seeing positive, enduring results (see <a href="#table4_31">table 4-31</a>).</p>

          <p>To lead others and gauge correct duty performance, the Army has established standards for military activities.

        <p>Building trust forms on the bedrock of mutual respect, shared understanding, and common experiences. For teams and organizations to function at the highest level, a climate of trust needs to exist. Leaders create a climate of trust by displaying consistency in their actions, and through relationship-building behaviors such as coaching, counseling, and mentoring.

          <p>Leaders exhibit their beliefs about trust in their actions and behaviors. Setting a personal example inspires those around them to act in the same manner. The actions a leader models to subordinates communicates the values of the leader and the unit.

          <p>Building trust is not a passive exercise. Leaders develop trust in their organizations by taking actions to promote trust. Developing others through mentoring, coaching, and counseling builds trust. When a leader mentors effectively, they send a clear message: I trust you to build a stronger, more adaptable Army and continue the Army profession. Leaders build trust by developing positive relationships with peers, superiors, and subordinates (see <a href="#table4_36">table 4-36</a>).

          <p>Supporting institutional-based development means that leaders should focus on personal and subordinate development at the macro- and micro-levels: leaders are responsible for developing the Army as an institution (macro-level) and each individual (micro-level).

        <p>A leader’s ultimate purpose is to get results by accomplishing missions the right way. A leader gets results by providing guidance and managing resources as well as demonstrating the other leader competencies. This competency focuses on consistent and ethical task accomplishment through supervising, managing, monitoring, and guiding the team’s work. Taken together, these components of <i>gets results</i> require initiative on the part of the leader to make decisions, take action to solve problems, and accomplish the mission:</p>

          <p>Leaders are responsible for coordinating all the simultaneous team undertakings and resourcing subordinates to complete the mission properly. Army leaders must be detailed planners who actively organize and communicate priorities to their team to ensure task execution in the right place, at the right time, in the right operational environment (see <a href="#table4_71">table 4-71</a>).</p>

          <p>Matching individuals and groups to a task can be a challenging undertaking, particularly when it comes to analyzing unit or organization capabilities.

It is important for leaders to understand a team’s individual interests to use their knowledge, skills, and abilities effectively as well as work toward their developmental needs (see <a href="#table4_72">table 4-72</a>).</p>

Designating, clarifying, and deconflicting duties and responsibilities improves a team’s motivation and commitment as it ensures that team members know they are expected to contribute to the mission.</p>

          <p>One of a leader’s main responsibilities is to accomplish the mission using the available resources in the most effective and efficient ways possible (see <a href="#table4_74">table 4-74</a>). Some Army leaders specialize in managing single categories of resources, such as ammunition, food, or finances, but everyone has an interest in seeing teams use all categories of resources wisely. A leader’s resources include time, labor, and money.</p>

          <p>A work obstacle is anything that stands in the way of getting the task done (see <a href="#table4_75">table 4-75</a>). Army leaders must remove or find ways to overcome multiple obstacles including resource shortages; competing or conflicting tasks; personnel issues; new requirements, regulations, or policies; lack of integration among different branches of an organization; and a failure to synchronize and coordinate efforts.</p>

          <p>Consistent and regular feedback provided through coaching, counseling, and mentoring has multiple benefits. Feedback helps a person improve at their position by identifying specific areas in which they excel as well as those in need of improvement.

          <p>Properly executing plans to accomplish the mission involves careful task management to ensure plans are implemented effectively and efficiently through the task lifecycle. This involves managing the scope, schedule, time, cost, quality, risk, communications, human resources, and project integration. Army leaders must be organized and clear in their requests of others, ensuring all issues are handled proactively and the project is carefully monitored to ensure alignment with the desired outcomes (see <a href="#table4_79">table 4-79</a>).</p>

Learn what limits active listening. Consider how often you say “Yes, but ” or “Let’s get to the point.” Do you check your mobile device or continue to type on the computer during conversations? These behaviors display an unwillingness to listen and limit conversation.</p>
