              <h3 class="part2-title">Feedback</h3>
              <p class="p">Ask subordinates for feedback on the frequency and quality of performance feedback you provide. Do subordinates consider it helpful and timely? Do they modify their behaviors?</p>
              <p class="p">Informally gain input from the team after completing a task or project. Collect the input first without offering feedback. Use information in a formal after action review.</p>
              <p class="p">Assess the frequency and quality of feedback you provide. Note who, when, and indications of how it was received. Seek a trusted subordinate’s input to verify your assessment.</p>
              <p class="p">Ensure subordinates understand what you communicate through feedback loops or ask questions such as: How will you implement this? What will you take away from our discussion? What changes do you plan to make immediately?</p>
              <p class="p">Observe someone who provides accurate, effective, and frequent feedback. Determine if you can adopt or incorporate aspects of their approach.</p>
              <p class="p">Observe subordinates’ work to determine their strengths and developmental needs. Document and prioritize needs. Identify candidates for immediate feedback and coaching.</p>
