        <p><b>4-1.</b> This chapter provides a deliberate and logical framework to support Army leaders developing themselves and others. These activities follow the same organization as the leader attributes and competencies found in the Army leadership requirements model (see ADP 6-22), to help individuals identify and prioritize which leader requirements to target for growth. The developmental activity tables follow a standard format: strength and need indicators, underlying causes, and recommended options to initiate action. The indicators provide ways to understand leader actions and confirm aspects of each leader behavior as a strength or a developmental need. The underlying causes provide more information on what the root cause may be for a developmental need. The tables provide three options for developmental action: feedback, study, and practice</p>

        <p><b>4-2.</b> To best use this chapter’s information, one identifies the competency and attribute behaviors for developmental focus. An individual may already have an IDP that documents goals and a plan for development or have an idea of what leadership competency or skill to develop. A coach, rater, counselor, or mentor can use this material to help focus leaders or subordinates on specific developmental goals and prepare for growth counseling. Different sources and events inform the process to identify developmental goals for competencies and behaviors as illustrated in <a href="#table4_1" onclick="document.getElementById('table4_1').open = true;">table 4-1</a>.</p>

          <p><b>Tip:</b> When considering learning and developmental activities, some automatically think about taking a formal training course or reading. While these may be helpful, leaders are encouraged to select developmental activities that fit with personal preferences and situation. It is important to think through personal and career goals when deciding on a developmental activity.</p>

          <h3 class="part2-title">Employing Leadership Requirements Model Developmental Activities</h3>
          <p class="p">CPT Kenny and 1SG Mac are briefing LTC Day on an upcoming team live fire exercise. At the end, LTC Day asks what competencies or attributes from the leadership requirements model they are targeting with the training event. Neither could answer the question.</p>
          <p class="p">LTC Day: “Gentlemen, your plan is sound, and the outcome will be trained teams ready to move into greater collective training, but we are missing an opportunity to develop our leaders here. Training without thought of the LRM is like an unguided missile, it gets the job done, but we owe it to our subordinate leaders to be precise. Don’t let leader development just happen, be deliberate and actively plan for it.”</p>
          <p class="p">CPT Kenny and 1SG Mac return to their office to discuss what LTC Day said.</p>
          <p class="p">CPT Kenny: “I understand what LTC Day said, and I know our leaders need some work. We have both worked with them on their IDPs. Several things almost derailed our individual training leading up to this, mostly centered on communication. What should we do to focus on that?”</p>
          <p class="p">1SG Mac: “We wanted to get better tactically, but maybe we should have been more specific. We know what we want to improve, we just didn’t select competencies to work on. Perhaps we can alter our training scenarios to deliberately target communication between leaders.”</p>
          <p class="p">After NTC, the OC/T, CPT Smole, is conducting the final AAR with the company. CPT Smole: “Let me begin by saying that it was truly a pleasure to watch this company operate during this rotation. You clearly put emphasis on communication during training because everyone was on the same common operating picture from the command team to the lowest private and it showed in how well you adjusted to changes in the plan.…”</p>
          <div class="part  quoted">
            <p class="p">I never would have thought that I could design training that would deliberately develop attributes or competencies without LTC Day asking the right questions. Nor would I have thought that it would work. Once we figured it out though, we incorporated it into everything we did and every leader could always tell me what the training objective, and developmental objective, for every event was. I had no greater pleasure as a company commander than deliberately developing my subordinates and watching them progress into great leaders in their own right.</p>

        <p><b>4-23.</b> Humility, as an attribute of an Army leader’s character, is the absence of arrogance. To be a leader, one must be confident and competent. Effective leaders temper confidence with humility. However, it is often difficult to judge one’s own humility. Humility is a subjective perception based on a leader’s behaviors and interpretations differ based on cultural or gender context. The attribute humility has one component: Seek feedback and explore personal performance (see <a href="#table4_12" onclick="document.getElementById('table4_12').open = true;">table 4-12</a>).</p>

      <div class="part  enumeration" id="part-4-24">
        
        <p><b>4-24.</b> Humility exists on a continuum. Effective leaders exhibit an appropriate degree of humility. Others view a leader who expresses excess humility as being meek, timid, or overly passive. Conversely, others consider a leader who expresses too little humility as overconfident or arrogant. A leader lacking self- confidence may feel the need to hide any perception of weakness and may display arrogant behavior as a result while a self-confident individual is free to demonstrate humility. A leader who expresses too much or too little humility lacks self-awareness. This, in turn undermines confidence in the leader’s ability to make good decisions and achieve success.</p>

        <p><b>4-36.</b> Mental agility is a flexibility of mind that allows leaders to adapt to uncertain or changing situations. Agility allows leaders to anticipate changing situations and think through second- and third-order effects. Mentally agile leaders develop and implement alternative approaches when current actions are not producing the desired results. Adaptation involves knowing or deciding whether to adapt, what to adapt to, over what timeframe to adapt, and how to adapt. Adaptability is enabled by—</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="li">
            <p>Recognizing the need for change or recognize a need to act.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="li">
            <p>Knowing the cues that point to real, meaningful differences and cause-effect relationships.</p>
          </li>

            <p>Having a keen ability to discriminate among environmental cues.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="li">
            <p>Having flexible knowledge triggered from different cues. Useful knowledge is likely structured in modular chunks that can recombine in new ways. Understanding the principles and theory behind facts contributes to applying knowledge in novel ways. This characteristic is cognitive flexibility.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="li">
            <p>Seeing multiple sides of an issue and a drive to work toward the best one. Often, multiple sides need integration to derive the best perspective. Openness, seeing opposites, selecting the best of opposing approaches, designing compromise, or resolving contradictions aid integration.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="li">
            <p>Thinking in reverse time. This involves being able to think from a desired end state through the prior steps that reach it. It may involve going from constraints or possibilities to figure what is doable, what are plausible goals.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="li">
            <p>Handling multiple lines of thought. Involves tracking numerous issues or questions, prioritizing among them, remembering lesser issues while maintaining an overarching perspective, and returning to think about lesser issues when time is available.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="li">
            <p>Changing perspective. Referred to as decentering, this involves an ability to move away from one's center or viewpoint to overcome thinking obstacles and blind spots.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="li">
            <p>Thinking in progressively deeper ways. Involves thinking at the right level of depth and breadth that optimize effort on thinking to match the gravity of the situation.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="li">
            <p>Predicting. Involves going beyond first-order or obvious meaning, to broaden thinking to future classes of situations.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="li">
            <p>Visualizing and conceptualizing. Involves ability to imagine complex or unusual relationships, possibilities, or unforeseen consequences and relationships.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="li">
            <p>Thinking holistically. Involves seeing wholes, sets of relationships and interactions, instead of analytical, decomposed, individual, or isolated parts. Relates to an ability to "see" in dynamics— moving pictures—instead of a static snapshot.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="li">
            <p>Mentally simulating what could happen.

A leader builds a subordinate’s confidence to solve problems and accept responsibility, sets conditions that foster taking initiative, and encourages input from anyone who understands the subject matter (see <a href="#table4_63" onclick="document.getElementById('table4_63').open = true;">table 4-63</a>).</p>
