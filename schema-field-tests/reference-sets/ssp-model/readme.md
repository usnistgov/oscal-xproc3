# The bug

Rules given by the SSP metaschema as respects `port-range` are *contradictory*, because rules 2 and 3 are inverted, expressing not the correct condition but the error condition.

The correct condition in each case reduces to rule 1.

Metaschema definition for `port-range` https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/4f02dac6f698efda387cc5f55bc99581eaf494b6/src/metaschema/oscal_implementation-common_metaschema.xml#L280

```xml
<constraint>
   <expect level="WARNING" id="port-range-start-and-end-not-specified" target="." test="exists(@start) and exists(@end)">
         <message>If a protocol is defined, it should include a start and end port range. To define a single port, the start and end should be the same value.</message>

Please see attached the sample SSP, FedRAMPâ€™s template, and the port-range WARNINGS 

[WARNING] [/system-security-plan/system-implementation[1]/component[2]/protocol[1]/port-range[1]] A start port exists, but an end point does not. To define a single port, the start and end should be the same value.
