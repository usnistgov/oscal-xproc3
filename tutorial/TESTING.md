# TESTING tutorial files

Testing for the resources in this subdirectory is only provided interactively, at present.

No regression testing is provided for - that remains a TODO item. But demonstration pipelines might better be located and tested in their own project directory - if it is here, that is because it is rough or unfinished.

Conceptualizing the regression testing for the dynamic assembly will be interesting.
