# XProc Dashboard

Keeping a list of resources for XProc 3.0.

## In this repository

Assuming pipelines have been run, resources documenting XProc are available here:

- [XProc 3.0 Atomic Steps](out/xproc-step-list.html) - lists all core and community-extension steps, with code templates
- [Directory of repository XProc](out/repository-step-list.html) - XProc in this repository

The pipelines to produce these:

- [../xproc-doc/XPROC-STEP-INDEX-HTML.xpl](../xproc-doc/XPROC-STEP-INDEX-HTML.xpl) produces a directory to the standard XProc atomic steps, with links to specifications
- [../xproc-doc/REPOSITORY-STEP-INDEX-HTML.xpl](../xproc-doc/REPOSITORY-STEP-INDEX-HTML.xpl) produces an index or synopsis view of XProc pipelines in this repository

## XProc historical

XProc 1.0 information is collected in [its archive](https://archive.xproc.org/).

In order to align with XSLT and XPath 3.0, XProc skipped a 2.0 version.

A commodity open-source XProc 1.0 implementation remains [XML Calabash](https://xmlcalabash.com/).
