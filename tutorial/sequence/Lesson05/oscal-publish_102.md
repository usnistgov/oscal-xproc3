# 102: Publishing OSCAL

## Goals

## Prerequisites

Run the pipelines described in [the 101 Lesson](oscal-publish_101_src.html)

## Resources

Like the [101 lesson](oscal-publish_101_src.html), this lesson unit uses the [oscal-from-pdf project](../../../projects/oscal-publish/readme.md) in this repo.

Publishing your own OSCAL in these pipelines is also worth trying - the worst they can do is fail. Bring OSCAL, especially OSCAL catalogs.

OSCAL JSON catalogs can be accommodated by splicing together a conversion pipeline with a publishing pipeline, as described in the exercise.

## Step One: any old OSCAL catalog

## Step Two: publishing OSCAL JSON
