# 599: Meeting XProc

## Some observations

Because it is now centered on *pipelines* as much as on files and software packages, dependency management is different from other technologies including Java and NodeJS â€“ how so?

MorganaXProc-III is implemented in Scala, and Saxon is built in Java, but otherwise distributions including the SchXSLT and XSpec distributions consist mainly of XSLT. This is either very good (with development and maintenance requirements in view), or not good at all.

Which is it, and what are the determining variables that tell you XProc is a good fit? How much of this is due to the high-level, abstracted nature of [4GLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth-generation_programming_language) including both XSLT 3.1 and XProc 3.0? Prior experience with XML-based systems and the problem domains in which they work well is probably a factor. How much are the impediments technical, and how much are they due to culture?

The next lesson unit includes more information on where to learn about XProc and how to become familiar not only with its uses in connection with OSCAL, but in general.
