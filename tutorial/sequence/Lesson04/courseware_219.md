# Courseware 219: Learn by Teaching

## Goals

Help yourself, your team and allies.

Produce a useful spin-off from a task or problem you need to master anyway.

Learn not only by doing but by writing it down for yourself and others.

## Prerequisites

Those with no prior experience in XSLT or declarative markup might think about that before venturing into these waters. This is an awesome exercise but faking it takes you only so far. This lesson segment assumes you will write content in HTML as well as giving you the chance to extend XProc and XSLT as you see fit.

Writing HTML by hand can be arduous; accordingly, for producing tutorial pages we have used a structured XML authoring environment (oXygen XML Author) with many features including styling in display; full control over styling; Schematron rules in the background along with UI support for content corrections according to those rules; etc.

However, any text editor or programmers' coding environment also works (to whatever extent generic HTML is supported), and Schematrons applied to HTML files can be run in XProc (as described).

## Resources

* Everything in the course you have seen so far
* Everything else you have seen relating to XProc
* Your own problems
* Your own examples

## Improve or enhance a lesson or lesson unit

Astute readers will have observed that a markup-based deployment invites editing. But the authoring or data acquisition model of this tutorial is not Markdown-based - Markdown is paradoxically not used for its intended purpose but as one of several **publication** formats for this data set, which is currently written in an XML-based HTML5 tag set defined for the project. By writing, querying and indexing in XHTML we can use XProc from the start. Extensibility and flexibility in publication is one of the strengths - to publish a new or rearranged tutorial sequence can be done with a few lines and commands. A drag and drop interface supporting XProc makes this even easier, while it is already installed and running under CI/CD, meaning both editorial and code quality checks can be done with every commit.

Improving a page is as simple as editing the copy found in XXX and XXX ...

Making and deploying a new pages is a little harder: XXX ...

### Apply Schematron to your edits

## Create a new lesson unit ('area')

## Produce a new project and document it with a tutorial
