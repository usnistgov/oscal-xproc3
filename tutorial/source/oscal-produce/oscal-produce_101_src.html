      <h1>101: Producing OSCAL from a publication format</h1>
      <section>
         <h2>Goals</h2>
         <p>Learn how high-quality XML can be produced from uncontrolled source data, in this case an HTML file (web
            page) produced by a commodity tool (Adobe Acrobat) from a publicly-available PDF document. The example
            document is US Army Field Manual (FM) 6-22, edition of 2022: <b>Developing Leaders</b>. Its Chapter 4 in
            particular offers a well-structured data set rich in what is called <q>semantics</q> - while that term is
            not here defined - or at least arguably shows a vivid instance of how electronic forms of expression (XML,
            markup) can make it possible to translate semantics, however defined, into applications.</p>
         <p>Observe how a deterministic data processing framework can be tuned or programmed to resolve anomalies in
               <q>bad inputs</q> (but not so bad), producing a well-formatted, cleanly encoded edition at a higher level
            of quality and capability, using a traceable and verifiable process.</p>
         <p>Along the way, learn something about XProc, XSLT transformations, XML, NISO STS format (a standard encoding
            for supporting publication in electronic formats), OSCAL, US Army field manuals and documentation, and the
            focus of FM 6-22: Leadership and leadership development.</p>

         <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
         <p>You have succeeded in prior exercises, including tools installation and setup.</p>
         <p>You are familiar with NIST SP 800-53, rev. 5, the publication that provides the model and requirements set
            for this application, in its <a
               href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf">final PDF
            revision</a>.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Resources</h2>
         <p>This unit relies on the <a href="../../../projects/oscal-publish/readme.md">oscal-publish project</a> in
            this repository, with its files. Like other projects this one may have installation or setup pipelines to
            run.</p>
         <p>Additionally if you have your own OSCAL to bring, especially OSCAL catalogs, bring them along.</p>
         <p><a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf">SP  800-53 rev 5
               (PDF)</a> is an essential reference.</p>

      <section>
         <h2>Step one: acquire resources</h2>
         <p>As usual, the project contains pipelines to be used to acquire copies of resources, placing them in the
            project lib directory . These may include dependencies for steps in the pipeline (read details in the <a
               href="oscal-produce_102_src.html">102 lesson</a>) so it is a good idea to run them all.</p>
         <p>These include a pipeline that copies the PDF original from which the HTML input (next step) was derived,
            using a COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) tool. Inspect and read this PDF to see what the upstream data looks
            like - and get a sense of what the data set looks like when the structures are <q>painted</q> on the
            page.</p>
         <p>The extraction and mapping focuses on Chapter 4 only of this document. Learn more about FM 6-22,
               <i>Developing Leaders</i> in <a href="../../../projects/oscal-import/readme.md">the project
            readme</a>.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Step two: examine HTML source data</h2>
         <p>For this exercise, we have already produced HTML from the PDF source: find it cached as an <a
               href="../../../projects/oscal-import/source/export/fm6_22.html">input file in the project folder</a>.
            Next to it is <a href="../../../projects/oscal-import/source/export/fm6_22_e.html">a copy with whitespace
               added for legibility</a>, which may be easier to inspect.</p>
         <p>Compare this to the PDF document you have downloaded (or the document on line). Open the HTML file in a web
            browser to see what it looks like in display, but also inspect its source code. You don't have to read it:
            just seeing it is enough.</p>
         <section>
            <h3>Warning: fragile!</h3>
            <p><i>Do not delete, replace, rename or alter this file</i>, as all the subsequent processing is tuned
               specifically to it, its internal organization, regularities and anomalies. Another process input - even
               an HTML file showing the same text (to any definition of <q>same</q>) - is highly unlikely to deliver
               acceptable results from the pipeline. This is an important factor to keep in mind when considering the
               scalability of the operation demonstrated. Producing a clean and legible <i>encoding</i> for the document
               does not require less expertise than producing the original; in some ways (for example with respect to
               knowledge of text encoding formats) it requires more.</p>
            <p>For some data sets, however, even a bespoke transformation pipeline such as this can be profitable, even
               beyond its impacts in greater availability and utility of the information. The expense and effort may be
               warranted when the source document is of such high quality and consistency instrinsically, that exposing
               its <q>native semantics</q> via a rational and explicable text encoding - a standards-based, platform-
               and application-independent encoding - such as OSCAL - becomes attractive for the specific kinds of
               affordances – the leverage – it gives for processing the information. In FM 6-22 Chapter 4, we have
               exactly such a document, which fits well into standards-based documentary formats such as NISO STS and,
               eventually, OSCAL.</p>
            <p>Because PDF is relatively opaque, extracting data from a PDF file with format intact is not a trivial
               exercise. PDF is arguably not a <q>data format</q> at all, but a language used to control a device for
               casting pixels and glyphs onto a page or screen. This being its purpose, no tool can do more – at least
               without the benefit of an external information source – than create outputs that <i>appear</i> to present
               the document with its organization and information intact, if rendered on screen with an appropriate tool
               (such as, in the case of an HTML rendition of the page, a web browser). In so doing it may meet a low
               baseline of functional requirement - the document is legible - while failing to meet others. In
               particular: failing to meet requirements for clean and well-structured data fit for reuse in a broad
               range of scenarios and applications, not only page production.</p>
            <p>Indeed this HTML file makes an excellent example of the kind of rather-poor encoding produced by a
               market-leading HTML export utility. Experts in data conversion might find other ways to make better
               encoding from the PDF - a task out of scope for us. (As we are not trying to find the best export
               utility, but on the contrary to demonstrate methods available so we do not have to do so.) This HTML is
               good enough, and that is what is often available.</p>

         <h2>Step three: run the pipeline</h2>
         <p>The pipeline starts by loading <a href="../../../projects/oscal-import/source/export/fm6_22.html"
               >source/export/fm6_22.html</a></p>
         <p>It produces output files in a <code>temp</code> directory. If you want to save out any of these outputs, you
            can copy files out, or edit the pipeline.</p>
         <p>Two files are created, both representing the Field Manual, each in a different format:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>NISO STS (Standards Tag Suite) format describes the full text, with tables, in XML</li>
            <li>OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment Language) factors out a richer <q>semantic</q> view of the data
               in OSCAL format, again presenting the full text of Chapter 4, but this time with externalized control
               sets, representing 25 <b>attributes</b> and 50 <b>competencies</b> as these are described in Field Manual
               6-22 and its related documents such as ADRP 6-22 (describing the US Army Leadership Requirements
               Model).</li>
         </ul>
