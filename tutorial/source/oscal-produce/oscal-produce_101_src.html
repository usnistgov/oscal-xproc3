      <h1>101: Producing OSCAL from a publication format</h1>
      <section>
         <h2>Goals</h2>
         <p>Learn how high-quality XML can be produced from uncontrolled source data, with several examples.</p>
         <p>Observe how a deterministic data processing framework can be tuned or programmed to resolve anomalies in
               <q>bad inputs</q>, producing a well-formatted, cleanly encoded edition at a higher level of quality and
            capability, using a traceable and verifiable process.</p>
         <p>Along the way, learn something about XProc, XSLT transformations, XML, NISO STS format (a standard encoding
            for supporting publication in electronic formats), OSCAL, the US Digital Service, US Army field manuals and
            documentation, and the focus of FM 6-22: Leadership and leadership development.</p>

         <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
         <p>You have succeeded in prior exercises, including tools installation and setup.</p>
         <p>You are familiar with NIST SP 800-53, rev. 5, the publication that provides the model and requirements set
            for this application, in its <a
               href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf">final PDF
            revision</a>.</p>

      <section>
         <p>Several projects in the repository (at time of writing) produce OSCAL data from inputs that are not OSCAL.
            They each produce the same kind of result: an OSCAL catalog (XML document). Beyond this they represent a
            range of cases in both complexity and goals:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>USDS Playbook â€“ 13 OSCAL controls (high level) from a simple web page produced by the US Digital
               Service</li>
            <li>NIST SP 800-171 from NIST Computer Cybersecurity and Privacy Reference Tool (CPRT) JSON</li>
            <li>US Army Field Manual 6-22 - via HTML from PDF source, with NISO STS format as an additional result</li>
         </ul>
         <p><i>Caution: all produced versions of these public documents are non-normative, unauthorized (lawful within
               terms of reuse in the public domain) and not for publication, being produced only for demonstration of
               tools and capabilities.</i></p>
         <h2>Step one: review projects</h2>
         <p>XXX As usual, the project contains pipelines to be used to acquire copies of resources, placing them in the
            project lib directory . These may include dependencies for steps in the pipeline (read details in the <a
               href="oscal-produce_102_src.html" class="LessonUnit">102 lesson</a>) so it is a good idea to run them
            all.</p>
         <p>These include a pipeline that copies the PDF original from which the HTML input (next step) was derived,
            using a COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) tool. Inspect and read this PDF to see what the upstream data looks
            like - and get a sense of what the data set looks like when the structures are <q>painted</q> on the
            page.</p>
         <p>The extraction and mapping focuses on Chapter 4 only of this document. Learn more about FM 6-22,
               <i>Developing Leaders</i> in <a href="../../../projects/oscal-import/readme.md">the project
            readme</a>.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Step two: examine inputs and outputs</h2>
         <p>XXX For this exercise, we have already produced HTML from the PDF source: find it cached as an <a
               href="../../../projects/oscal-import/source/export/fm6_22.html">input file in the project folder</a>.
            Next to it is <a href="../../../projects/oscal-import/source/export/fm6_22_e.html">a copy with whitespace
               added for legibility</a>, which may be easier to inspect.</p>
         <p>Compare this to the PDF document you have downloaded (or the document on line). Open the HTML file in a web
            browser to see what it looks like in display, but also inspect its source code. You don't have to read it:
            just seeing it is enough.</p>
         <section>
            <h3>XXX Warning: fragile!</h3>
            <p>Pipelines can vary in how much error handling or implicit <q>hand holding</q> they can do. The USDS
               Playbook example shows a case that may arguably be over-engineered, in the sense that it is more complex
               than the problem should warrant. For example, instead of binding to expected inputs, it loads them
               dynamically, giving an error message instead when they are missing (with a hint on how they can be
               acquired). The benefit is that this shows how XProc pipelines can be made to be more forgiving (of
               predictable errors) as well as easier to use.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless even a pipeline designed to be robust will not work if any required input is not
               available.</p>

      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Step three: run pipelines</h2>
         <p>XXX The pipeline starts by loading <a href="../../../projects/oscal-import/source/export/fm6_22.html"
               >source/export/fm6_22.html</a>.</p>
         <p>It produces output files in a <code>temp</code> directory. If you want to save out any of these outputs, you
            can copy files out, or edit the pipeline.</p>
         <p>Two files are created, both representing the Field Manual, each in a different format:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>NISO STS (Standards Tag Suite) format describes the full text, with tables, in XML</li>
            <li>OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment Language) factors out a richer <q>semantic</q> view of the data
               in OSCAL format, again presenting the full text of Chapter 4, but this time with externalized control
               sets, representing 25 <b>attributes</b> and 50 <b>competencies</b> as these are described in Field Manual
               6-22 and its related documents such as ADRP 6-22 (describing the US Army Leadership Requirements
               Model).</li>
         </ul>
