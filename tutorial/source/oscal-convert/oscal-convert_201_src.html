      <h1>201: Anatomy of an XProc pipeline</h1>
      <section>
         <h2>Goals</h2>
         <p>Get more in-depth information about XProc internals, including especially the parts of an XProc pipeline
            step, as a step.</p>
         <p>This includes its imports, its prologue, subpipeline and steps.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
         <p>You have succeeded in prior exercises, including tools installation and setup. You have seen enough XProc to
            be impressed, at least, by the concept.</p>
      </section>

         <h2>Resources</h2>
         <p>Pipelines throughout the repository serve as examples for the description that follows.</p>

         <h2>XProc as XML</h2>
         <p>An XProc pipeline takes the form of an XML <q>document entity</q>. Unless you are concerned to write an XML
            parser (which is not very likely for XProc's natural constituency), this typically means an XML file, that
            is to say a file encoded in plain text (typically the UTF-8 serialization of Unicode, or alternatively
            another form of <q>plain text</q> supported by your system or environment), and following the rules of XML
            syntax. These rules include how elements and attributes and other XML features are encoded in <b>tags</b>
            that:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Follow the rules with respect to naming, whitespace, delimiters and reserved characters</li>
            <li>Are correctly balanced, with an end tag for every start tag – for a <code>&lt;start></code> there must
               be a <code>&lt;/start></code> (an end to the start).</li>
            <li>Are cleanly nested with no overlap: end tags always close the most recently opened element, so no
               element ever extends beyond the boundaries of its <q>ancestor</q> or containing elements</li>
         </ul>
         <p>These rules are fairly simple, and they are well supported by tools designed to read and write XML – to
            respect, follow and enforce the rules on our behalf.</p>
         <p>Thus they are also quickly and easily internalized, often in only a few minutes of working with XML.</p>
         <p>Over and above being XML, XProc has some rules of its own ...</p>
         <section>
            <h3>XProc at the top</h3>
            <p>At the very top of an XProc file, expect to see something not unlike this:</p>
            <pre>&lt;p:declare-step version="3.0"
   xmlns:p="http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc"
   xmlns:ox="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal-xproc3"
   type="ox:TEST-XPROC3"
   name="TEST-XPROC3">
...
&lt;/p:declare-step></pre>
            <p>XProc pipelines are XML documents using the XProc vocabulary. At the top (paradoxically, we call this the
                  <q>root</q>), an XProc instance is identified by tagging it either of <code>p:declare-step</code> or
                  <code>p:library</code>. XProc in this repository includes at least one <code>p:library</code>, and it
               might be nice to have more. More on this below.</p>
            <p>As noted next, the element at the top ordinarily provides namespace prefix bindings (namespace
               declaration attributes) along with a <code>name</code> and a <code>type</code> for the step.</p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h3>Namespaces</h3>
            <pre>   xmlns:p="http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc"
   xmlns:ox="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal-xproc3"</pre>
            <p>Namespaces are discussed <a href="oscal-convert_350_src.html" class="LessonUnit">soon enough</a>. Here it
               suffices to reiterate that XProc needs to be able to use its own namespace,
                  <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc</code>) at the very minimum, as well as others, both for the data
               sets in scope (inputs and process results) and for processes: namespaces also serve to support
               extensibility. Accordingly you will probably also want a namespace (or more than one) whose prefix and
               URI bindings you control.</p>
            <p>Since namespaces declared at the top of the document will apply throughout the document (except when they
               are specifically switched off or around), this is a good place to put namespace declaration attributes to
               keep them out of the way and make them easier to find.</p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h3>@name and @type</h3>
            <p>On <code>p:declare-step</code>, whether at the top or in a step definition within a pipeline, either or
               both a <code>@name</code> and a <code>@type</code> are permitted.</p>
            <pre>   type="ox:TEST-XPROC3"
   name="TEST-XPROC3"</pre>
            <p>The name makes it possible to reference the step by name. This is often useful and sometimes more or less
               essential, for example for providing input to one step from another step's output. (We say <q>more or
                  less essential</q> because the processor will produce names for itself as a fallback, if it needs
               them, but these are brittle, somewhat opaque – such as <code>!1.2.3</code> – and more difficult to use
               than the names a developer gives.)</p>
            <p>Understandably, the name of an XProc must be different from the names given to all the steps in the XProc
               (which must also be distinct).</p>
            <p>This repository follows a rule that a step name should correspond to its file base name (i.e., without a
               filename suffix), so <code>identity_</code> for <code>identity_.xproc</code>, etc. But that is a rule for
               us, not for XProc in general.</p>
            <p>A step may also have an assigned <code>@type</code>. Unlike the name, which can be in any namespace or
               none, the <code>@type</code> must be assigned to a namespace.</p>
         </section>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Prologue and body</h2>
         <p>A pipeline will typically be a collection or sequence of steps, of arbitrary complexity. By this we mean
            that any step might be simple or complex in its operations; and the sequence may be short or long, or simple
            and singular or branching, multiple (with respect to inputs or outputs) and conditional. A pipeline provides
            such a collection of steps with an interface, indeed (if one dare say) <q>semantics</q> in the form of a
            specification, whether explicit or implicit, of what constitute valid inputs, expected outputs, and
            recognized runtime options. This interface is defined in the pipeline's <em>prologue</em>. The sequence or
            arrangement of steps, however long or short, constitutes the pipeline's <em>body</em> and serve as the
            pipeline's <a href="https://spec.xproc.org/3.0/xproc/#declare-pipelines">subpipeline</a> .</p>
         <p>Think of the subpipeline as the working parts of the pipeline, while the prologue dictates how they, as a
               <q>body</q>, are to be invoked, and with what kinds of results exposed to the calling system – that is,
            what kinds of information (<em>results</em>) are made available for disposition (as opposed to simply being
            visible as messages or result artifacts).</p>
         <p>Before the prologue, of course, we see optional import declarations. Add to these any local step definitions
            (not common but not unheard of), and at a high level we see these element groups:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Imports (optional) - configuring where the processor can find logic to be called from external
               pipelines: <code>p:import</code>, <code>p:import-functions</code></li>
            <li>Prologue - configuring inputs, outputs and options for the pipeline, if any - the prologue can be empty:
               , <code>p:input</code>, <code>p:output</code>, <code>p:option</code></li>
            <li>Local step definitions, if any: <code>p:declare-step</code>
            </li>
            <li>Subpipeline - step invocations, connected implicitly or explicitly, with supporting variable
               declarations and documentation</li>
         </ul>
         <p>In total, the list of elements coming before the subpipeline is short, which helps: six in total between
               <code>p:import</code> and <code>p:declare-step</code>. Everything coming after is part of the
            subpipeline.</p>
         <p>Imports will be discussed later, or can be reasoned about readily from examples.</p>
         <p>The <em>prologue</em> is used to define <em>ports</em> and <em>options</em> for the pipeline.  Defining
            ports and options is how you give the users of the step with the affordances or control points they need to
            use it. It is common and conventional to have a single input port named <code>source</code> as <em>primary
               input</em>. But some pipelines require no input bindings since they acquire data in other ways. If your
            pipeline is intended to be self-contained, its prologue can be empty. More commonly, ports and options are
            defined, at least to provide default settings.</p>
         <p>Keep in mind that just because a pipeline has no exposed ports for inputs or outputs, does not mean it does
            nothing. Among other things, pipelines can read and write (or be asked to write) arbitrary resources to a
            file system. Its exposed interfaces provide for functional composition: since they have inputs and outputs,
            pipelines can be used as steps in pipelines. But those do not in any way preclude its operations. XProc is
               <i>not</i> side-effect free.</p>
         <p>Following the prologue, a step may also have local step definitions (<code>p:declare-step</code>). One might
            think of these as an XProc equivalent of a <q>macro</q>: these locally-defined pipelines can be used
            internally for logic that is used repeatedly, or that warrants separating from the main pipeline for some
            other reason.</p>
         <p>After imports, prologue and (optional) step declarations, the step sequence that follows comprises the <a
               href="https://spec.xproc.org/3.0/xproc/#dt-subpipeline">subpipeline</a>.</p>
         <p>One other complication: among the steps in the subpipeline, <code>p:variable</code> (a variable declaration)
            and <code>p:documentation</code> (for pipeline documentation) are also permitted – these are not properly
            steps, but can be useful to have with them.</p>
         <p>In summary with more detail: any XProc pipeline, viewed as a step declaration, can have the following:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Pipeline name and type assignment (if needed), given as attributes at the top</li>
            <li><b>Imports</b>: step declarations, step libraries and functions to make available</li>
            <li>The pipeline <b>prologue</b>: any of the elements named <code>p:input</code>, <code>p:output</code> and
                  <code>p:option</code>, defining this pipeline's ports and options</li>
            <li>Optionally (and not common): step declarations for local steps, appearing at
               <code>p:declare-step</code>. Each of these will have its own name, type, prologue and steps</li>
            <li>For this pipeline, one or more steps, called the <a
                  href="https://spec.xproc.org/3.0/xproc/#dt-subpipeline">subpipeline</a><ul>
                  <li>Standard atomic and compound steps in XProc namespace (probably prefixed <code>p:</code>)</li>
                  <li>Imported steps - in their own namespaces (in this repository, prefixed <code>ox:</code>)</li>
                  <li>Variable declarations - <code>p:variable</code></li>
               </ul></li>
            <li>Finally, as noted above, <code>p:documentation</code> can appear anywhere in a pipeline, but it will be
               ignored except when appearing inside <code>p:inline</code>. What to do with these is a topic to be
               covered later.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>A useful exercise can be to open a few pipelines and distinguish its internal boundaries.</p>

         <h2>XProc steps</h2>
         <p>The <i>step</i> is the core conceptual unit of XProc. An XProc processing pipeline is composed of steps. But
            a pipeline is also considered as a step in itself. As such it can be used in other pipelines, and so on.</p>
         <p>In other words, steps in XProc are <i>compositional</i>. They are building block assemblies made out of
            smaller building block assemblies. A step is a way to process data. A pipeline is a way of orchestrating and
            arranging such processes.</p>
         <p>The distinction between pipelines and steps is relative and provisional, but important and useful. The
            pipeline is the logical and actual definition of how your data is to be processed. Every pipeline is
            composed of an arrangement, often a series, of operations. These operations – the steps – include
               <q>primitives</q>, being designed for generality and reusability for the most common operations. But they
            can also include new steps we have written, as pipelines, and such custom-designed steps can be used in
            combination with the primitives or core compound steps of the language.</p>
         <p>At a higher level, defining new steps with new step declarations, and using them in combination with other
            steps, is how we manage complexity and change in processing requirements. This strategy maximizes
            adaptability, while also supporting an <q>incremental maturity model</q>, in which all defined processes can
            be improved with reuse, building and testing over time. Careful use and deployment of new steps is how we
            save work, by focusing optimization and making it possible to scale up to address data processing
            requirement sets that are both large and complex.</p>
         <p>Thus a kind of <q>recursive orderability</q>, wherein encapsulation itself is scaled up and out arbitrarily
            but only as much as needed, is a secret to XProc. As a pipeline, a step definition may include only a single
            step (a pipeline can be an interface or wrapper to another pipeline, or to a simple operation), or a long
            sequence or complex choreography of steps. In either case it can become a relatively self-contained <q>black
               box</q> process available to other processes.</p>
         <p>Accommodating this design, an XProc <i>file</i> considered as an XML instance (as noted) is either of two
            things: a <i>step declaration</i>, or a collection of such declarations, a <i>library</i>. At the top level
            (as noted), recognize an XProc step declaration by the element, <code>p:declare-step</code> (in the XProc
            namespace) and a library by the element <code>p:library</code>.</p>
         <pre>&lt;p:declare-step xmlns:p="http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc" version="3.0" 
    name="a-first-step">
...
&lt;/p:declare-step></pre>
         <p>Additionally, step declarations can include their own pipeline (step) declarations, making a hybrid
            architecture: the pipeline comprises a step, with its own library not imported but in line. This can also be
            useful.</p>
         <p>An example of a step library in this repository is <a href="../../../xspec/xspec-execute.xpl"
               >xspec-execute.xpl</a>, which collects several steps supporting XSpec, one each for supporting the XSpec
            testing framework for XSLT, XQuery and Schematron respectively.</p>
         <p>The advantage of defining a step at the top level, rather than putting all steps into libraries, is that
            such a step can be invoked without prior knowledge of its type name, which is used by XProc to distinguish
            it from other steps. The pipeline simply needs to be presented to the processor, which does the rest. Your
            library of steps then looks very similar to your directory full of XProc files – and can be treated, where
            appropriately, as self-contained scripts encapsulating everything they need for a given runtime.</p>
         <section>
            <h3>Implications of XProc as XML</h3>
            <p>Like any language using XML syntax, XProc depends on a conceptual relation between primitive constructs
               of the language, and XML syntax, a relation that is ordinarily (and usefully) mediated by means of an
               (actual or putative) XML <i>data model</i> including elements, attributes, comment nodes, text nodes and
               so forth. XSLT is such a language, for example: it has its top-level <i>declarations</i>, its <i>template
                  rules</i> and its <i>instructions</i>, all of which are represented using elements in the (standard
               and most commonly used) XML syntax. Thus, part of learning XSLT is learning that <code>xsl:key</code> is
               syntax for a <em>key declaration</em> while <code>xsl:template</code> is a <em>template rule</em>.</p>
            <p>In the same way, elements in XProc's XML vocabulary correspond to structures in XProc - structures which
               developers and users rely on, as they define both the internals and the control interface for the
               language as a semantic construct - something that does something. In XProc, those structures include
               things like <b>documents</b>, <b>content-types</b> (think of <q>formats</q> such as XML and JSON),
                  <b>ports</b> and <b>steps</b>. Some XProc elements represent steps, others do not. (In the same way as
               an XSLT key declaration is not a template rule.) Learning this difference among others is how you learn
               XProc.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, the vocabulary of the language is not very large. Core XProc 3.0 has only 95 elements
               defined in its namespace (or 99, if you are strictly counting all element types defined, not just the
               names those elements are given). XProc 3.1 adds a few more. This includes elements for all the core and
               community-defined steps (recognizable by the prefix <code>p:</code>). Additional to these 95 might be
               other steps you acquire or define. As with any language, there are parts you will hardly ever use, while
               other parts are used routinely.</p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h3>XProc embedded documentation</h3>
            <p>An example of this is the XProc <code>p:documentation</code> element. This element is designed to carry
               documentation to a consuming application. Rather than mandate some kind of behavior for
                  <code>p:documentation</code> – something difficult or impossible to do for the general case, or to
               test –- the XProc rule is <q>anything marked as documentation is for some other consumer</q>, i.e. a
               documentation engine, not the XProc processor. In other words, a conformant processor <a
                  href="https://spec.xproc.org/3.0/xproc/#documentation"><i>must ignore</i> anything it sees</a> inside
                  <code>p:documentation</code>.</p>
            <p>There is a small loophole, namely that the effect of <code>p:inline</code> for capturing XML overrides
               this provision, so if you put <code>p:documentation</code> inside <code>p:inline</code>, it <q>becomes
                  visible</q> as inline content, not as XProc to be operated on (or not).</p>
            <p>As always it is up to the developer how thoroughly and in what form to include inline documentation. And
               short of managing a corpus of code documentation along with the code, placing explanatory remarks and
               code snippets into comments is a widely followed practice, and recommended for its combination of ease
               and usefulness.</p>
         </section>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Atomic and compound steps</h2>
         <p>Given an understanding of the organization of an XProc pipeline, the focus shifts to the steps themselves,
            which follow a common pattern. Briefly put, an atomic step is any step you use by simply invoking it with
            inputs and options: its logic is self-contained, and the operation it carries out is (at least conceptually)
            single and unified. A compound step, in contrast, combines one or more other steps in its own
               <em>subpipelines</em> and manages these together through a single interface, while providing – unlike an
            atomic step -- some other functionality depending on the step.</p>
         <p>XProc keeps things workable by providing only a few compound steps supporting the identified range of needs.
            This does not prove to be a practical limitation, since all steps including atomic steps can have multiple
            inputs and outputs, distinguished by type and role. (For example, a validation step might output both a copy
            of the input, potentially annotated, along with a validation report.) Atomic steps are not necessarily
            simple, and may include compound steps in their own subpipelines. All steps you define will be atomic steps.
            Accordingly, compound steps are not necessarily more complex than atomic steps: they are useful because they
            handle common contingencies such as splicing (with <code>p:viewport</code>), splitting (with
               <code>p:for-each</code>, perform an operation in parallel over a set of inputs, not a single document),
            conditionals (<code>p:if</code>, <code>p:choose</code>) and exception handling (<code>p:try</code> with
               <code>p:catch</code> and <code>p:finally</code>).</p>
         <p>Here are all the compound steps. All others are atomic steps.</p>

         <h2>Namespaces and extension steps</h2>
         <p>We recognize steps because we either recognize them by name - for standard steps in the <code>p:</code>
            (XProc) namespace such as <code>p:filter</code> and <code>p:add-attribute</code> - or sometimes by process
            of elimination – because they cannot be anything else. This is because extension steps, whether written or
            acquired, can be named anything. Fortunately, extension steps in XProc take the form of elements in an
               <em>extension namespace</em>. Generally speaking, that is, any element not prefixed with <code>p:</code>
            is treated as out of scope for XProc and to be ignored, while subject to evaluation as an extension.</p>
         <p>But this is an important category, since such extensions may include XProc steps whose functioning is core
            to the pipeline as a whole.</p>
         <details><summary>Question: Where are extension steps used in the XProcs run so far?</summary><p>One answer:
               The <a href="./../../../smoketest/TEST-XSPEC.xpl">XSpec smoke test</a> calls an extension step named
                  <code>ox:execute-xspec</code>, defined in an imported pipeline. In this document, the prefix
                  <code>ox</code> is bound to a utility namespace,
               <code>http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal-xproc3</code>.</p><p>In an XProc pipeline (library or step
               declaration) one may also see additional namespaces, including:</p><ul>
               <li>The namespaces needed for XSLT, XSD, or other supported technology</li>
               <li>One or more namespaces deployed by the XProc author to support either steps or internal operations
                  (for example, XSLT functions)</li>
               <li>The namespace <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc-step</code>, usually associated with the name prefix
                     <code>c:</code>. This namespace is designated by XProc in order to help standardize the interfaces
                  (inputs and outputs) supported by standard steps.</li>
               <li>The namespace <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc-error</code>, for XProc's error reporting</li>
            </ul>These declarations (often but not always at the top of the document) are critically important for XPath
            and hence for the correct operation of your pipelines. See <a
               href="https://spec.xproc.org/3.0/xproc/#namespaces">the specification</a> for more information.</details>
