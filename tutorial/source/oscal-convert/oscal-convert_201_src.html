         <h2>Overview: the anatomy of an XProc pipeline</h2>
         <p>Experts in XML can read this section quickly. Newcomers will find some of the concepts here (such as
            namespaces) also apply across XML- and XDM-based technologies including XSLT and Schematron. XDM is the <a
               href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel/">XQuery and XPath Data Model</a>, the foundation of XPath,
            XQuery and XSLT.</p>
         <section>
            <h3>XProc files</h3>
            <p>An XProc pipeline takes the form of an XML <q>document entity</q>. Unless you are concerned to write an
               XML parser (which is not very likely for XProc's natural constituency), this typically means an XML file,
               that is to say a file encoded in plain text (typically the UTF-8 serialization of Unicode, or
               alternatively another form of <q>plain text</q> supported by your system or environment), and following
               the rules of XML syntax. These rules include how elements and attributes and other XML features are
               encoded in <b>tags</b> that</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Follow the rules with respect to naming, whitespace, delimiters and reserved characters</li>
               <li>Are correctly balanced, with an end tag for every start tag – for a <code>&lt;start></code> there
                  must be a <code>&lt;/start></code> (an end to the start).</li>
               <li>Are cleanly nested with no overlap: end tags always close the most recently opened element, so no
                  element ever extends beyond the boundaries of its <q>ancestor</q> or containing elements</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These rules are fairly simple, and they are well supported by tools designed to read and write XML – to
               respect, follow and enforce the rules on our behalf.</p>
            <p>Thus they are also quickly and easily internalized, often in only a few minutes of working with XML.</p>
            <p>Over and above being XML, XProc has some rules of its own ...</p>
            <section>
               <h4>XProc document element</h4>
               <pre>&lt;p:declare-step version="3.0"
   xmlns:p="http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc"
   xmlns:ox="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal-xproc3"
   type="ox:TEST-XPROC3"
   name="TEST-XPROC3">
...
&lt;/p:declare-step></pre>
               <p>At the top, an XProc file will be either of <code>p:declare-step</code> or <code>p:library</code>.
                  XProc in this repository includes at least one <code>p:library</code>, and it might be nice to have
                  more. More on this below.</p>
               <p>As noted next, the element at the top ordinarily provides namespace prefix bindings (namespace
                  declaration attributes) along with a <code>name</code> and a <code>type</code> for the step.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <h4>Namespaces</h4>
               <pre>   xmlns:p="http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc"
   xmlns:ox="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal-xproc3"</pre>
               <p>Namespaces are discussed in a different lesson unit. Here it is enough to repeat that XProc needs its
                  own namespaces (typically p at the very minimum), while namespaces also serve to support
                  extensibility. Accordingly you will probably also want a namespace (or more than one) whose prefix and
                  URI bindings you control. Since namespaces declared at the top of the document will apply throughout
                  the document (except when they are specifically switched off or around), this is a good place to put
                  namespace declaration attributes to keep them out of the way.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <h4>@name and @type</h4>
               <p>On <code>p:declare-step</code>, whether at the top or in a step definition within a pipeline, either
                  or both a <code>@name</code> and a <code>@type</code> are permitted.</p>
               <pre>   type="ox:TEST-XPROC3"
   name="TEST-XPROC3"></pre>
               <p>The name makes it possible to reference the step by name. This is often useful and sometimes more or
                  less essential, for example for providing input to one step from another step's output. (We say
                     <q>more or less essential</q> because the processor will produce names for itself as a fallback, if
                  it needs them, but these are brittle, somewhat opaque – such as <code>!1.2.3</code> – and more
                  difficult to use than the names a developer gives.)</p>
               <p>Understandably, the name of an XProc must be different from the names given to all the steps in the
                  XProc (which must also be distinct). </p>
               <p>This repository follows a rule that a step name should correspond to its file base name (i.e., without
                  a filename suffix), so <code>identity_</code> for <code>identity_.xproc</code>, etc. But that is a
                  rule for us, not for XProc in general.</p>
               <p>A step may also have an assigned <code>@type</code>. Unlike the name, which can be in any namespace or
                  none, the <code>@type</code> must be assigned to a namespace.</p>

            <h3>Prologue and body</h3>
            <p>Keep in mind that to build a pipeline is also to design and deploy a step, since any pipeline can be used
               as a step, and any step may comprise, internally, a pipeline.</p>
            <p>Since step definitions are more often <q>out of line</q> (in an external file) than inline (in the XProc
               itself), learning XProc soon becomes an exercise in learning to use a toolkit of standard steps provided
               by the standard vocabulary. The power of these steps comes not just through what they do as single
               operations – which can be simple or complex – but in what they do when combined. Learning is accelerated
               by diving in.</p>
            <p>As described in the <a href="https://spec.xproc.org/3.0/xproc/#declare-pipelines">XProc 3.0
                  specification</a>, XProc step declarations can be divided into an initial set of elements for setup
               and configuration, followed by a <i>subpipeline</i>, consisting of a sequence of steps to be executed –
               any steps available, which could be anything. Think of the subpipeline as the working parts of the
               pipeline, while the rest is all about how it is set up.</p>
            <p>At a high level:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Imports (optional) - configuring where the processor can find logic to be called from external
                  pipelines: <code>p:import</code>, <code>p:import-functions</code></li>
               <li>Prologue - configuring inputs, outputs and options for the pipeline, if any - the prologue can be
                  empty: , <code>p:input</code>, <code>p:output</code>, <code>p:option</code></li>
               <li>Local step definitions, if any:  <code>p:declare-step</code>
               </li>
               <li>Subpipeline - step invocations, connected implicitly or explicitly, with supporting variable
                  declarations and documentation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The list of elements that come in the three groups before the subpipeline is short, which helps: six in
               total between <code>p:import</code> and <code>p:declare-step</code>. Everything coming after is part of
               the subpipeline.</p>
            <p>Within this set of elements (all preceding, none following the subpipeline) XProc further distinguishes
               between the <b>imports</b> for steps and functions, appearing first (elements <code>p:import</code> and
                  <code>p:import-functions</code>), followed by the <a
                  href="https://spec.xproc.org/3.0/xproc/#declare-pipelines">prologue</a> (<code>p:input</code>,
                  <code>p:output</code>, <code>p:option</code>).</p>
            <p>The prologue is used to define ports and options for the pipeline. It can be thought of as the definition
               of the interface for the step as a whole. Defining ports and options is how you give the users of the
               step with the affordances or control points they need to use it. If only a single input is needed, a
               single input port (named <code>source</code>) can be defined. But some pipelines require no input
               bindings since the acquire data in other ways. If your pipeline is self-contained, its prologue can be
               empty.</p>
            <p>Following the prologue, a step may also have local step definitions (<code>p:declare-step</code>). One
               might think of these as an XProc equivalent of a <q>macro</q>: these locally-defined pipelines can be
               used internally for logic that is used repeatedly, or that warrants separating from the main pipeline for
               some other reason.</p>
            <p>After imports, prologue and (optional) step declarations, the step sequence that follows comprises the <a
                  href="https://spec.xproc.org/3.0/xproc/#dt-subpipeline">subpipeline</a>.</p>
            <p>One other complication: among the steps in the subpipeline, <code>p:variable</code> (a variable
               declaration) and <code>p:documentation</code> (for out-of-band documentation) are also permitted – these
               are not properly steps, but can be useful to have with them.</p>
            <p>In summary: any XProc pipeline, viewed as a step declaration, can have the following --</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Pipeline name and type assignment (if needed), given as attributes at the top</li>
               <li><b>Imports</b>: step declarations, step libraries and functions to make available</li>
               <li>The pipeline <b>prologue</b>: any of the elements named <code>p:input</code>, <code>p:output</code>
                  and <code>p:option</code>, defining this pipeline's ports and options</li>
               <li>Optionally (and not common): step declarations for local steps, appearing at
                     <code>p:declare-step</code>. Each of these will have its own name, type, prologue and steps</li>
               <li>For this pipeline, one or more steps, called the <a
                     href="https://spec.xproc.org/3.0/xproc/#dt-subpipeline">subpipeline</a><ul>
                     <li>Standard atomic and compound steps in XProc namespace (probably prefixed <code>p:</code>)</li>
                     <li>Imported steps - in their own namespaces (in this repository, prefixed <code>ox:</code>)</li>
                     <li>Variable declarations - <code>p:variable</code></li>
                  </ul></li>
               <li>Finally, as noted above, <code>p:documentation</code> can appear anywhere in a pipeline, but it will
                  be ignored except when appearing inside <code>p:inline</code>. What to do with these is a topic to be
                  covered later.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A useful exercise can be to open a few pipelines and distinguish its internal boundaries.</p>

            <h3>XProc steps</h3>
            <p>The <i>step</i> is the core conceptual unit of XProc. An XProc processing pipeline is composed of steps.
               But a pipeline is also considered as a step in itself. As such it can be used in other pipelines, and so
               on.</p>
            <p>In other words, steps in XProc are <i>compositional</i>. They are building block assemblies made out of
               smaller building block assemblies. A step is a way to process data. A pipeline is a way of orchestrating
               and arranging such processes.</p>
            <p>The distinction between pipelines and steps is relative and provisional, but important and useful. The
               pipeline is the logical and actual definition of how your data is to be processed. Every pipeline is
               composed of an arrangement, often a series, of operations. These operations – the steps – include
                  <q>primitives</q>, being designed for generality and reusability for the most common operations. But
               they can also include new steps we have written, as pipelines, and such custom-designed steps can be used
               in combination with the primitives or core compound steps of the language.</p>
            <p>At a higher level, defining new steps with new step declarations, and using them in combination with
               other steps, is how we manage complexity and change in processing requirements. This strategy maximizes
               adaptability, while also supporting an <q>incremental maturity model</q>, in which all defined processes
               can be improved with reuse, building and testing over time. Careful use and deployment of new steps is
               how we save work, by focusing optimization and making it possible to scale up to address data processing
               requirement sets that are both large and complex.</p>
            <p>Thus a kind of <q>recursive orderability</q>, wherein encapsulation itself is scaled up and out
               arbitrarily but only as much as needed, is a secret to XProc. As a pipeline, a step definition may
               include only a single step (a pipeline can be an interface or wrapper to another pipeline, or to a simple
               operation), or a long sequence or complex choreography of steps. In either case it can become a
               relatively self-contained <q>black box</q> process available to other processes.</p>
            <p>Accommodating this design, an XProc <i>file</i> considered as an XML instance is either of two things: a
                  <i>step declaration</i>, or a collection of such declarations, a <i>library</i>. At the top level,
               recognize an XProc step declaration by the element, <code>p:declare-step</code> (in the XProc namespace)
               and a library by the element <code>p:library</code>.</p>
            <pre>&lt;p:declare-step xmlns:p="http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc" version="3.0" 
    name="a-first-step">
...
&lt;/p:declare-step></pre>
            <p>Additionally, step declarations can include their own pipeline (step) declarations, making a hybrid
               architecture: the pipeline comprises a step, with its own library not imported but in line. This can also
               be useful.</p>
            <p>An example of a step library in this repository is <a href="../../../xspec/xspec-execute.xpl"
                  >xspec-execute.xpl</a>, which collects several steps supporting XSpec, one each for supporting the
               XSpec testing framework for XSLT, XQuery and Schematron respectively.</p>
            <p>The advantage of defining a step at the top level, rather than putting all steps into libraries, is that
               such a step can be invoked without prior knowledge of its type name, which is used by XProc to
               distinguish it from other steps. The pipeline simply needs to be presented to the processor, which does
               the rest. Your library of steps then looks very similar to your directory full of XProc files.</p>
            <section>
               <h4>XProc as an XML document</h4>
               <p>Like any language using XML syntax, XProc depends on a conceptual relation between primitive
                  constructs of the language, and XML syntax, a relation that is ordinarily (and usefully) mediated by
                  means of an (actual or putative) XML <i>data model</i> including elements, attributes, comment nodes,
                  text nodes and so forth. XSLT is such a language, for example: it has its top-level
                     <i>declarations</i>, its <i>template rules</i> and its <i>instructions</i>, all of which are
                  represented using elements in the (standard and most commonly used) XML syntax. Thus, part of learning
                  XSLT is learning that <code>xsl:key</code> is syntax for a <q>key declaration</q> while
                     <code>xsl:template</code> is a <q>template rule</q>.</p>
               <p>In the same way, elements in XProc's XML vocabulary correspond to structures in XProc - structures
                  which developers and users rely on, as they define both the internals and the <q>control interface</q>
                  for the language as a semantic construct - something that <q>does something</q>. In XProc, those
                  structures include things like <b>documents</b>, <b>content-types</b> (think of <q>formats</q> such as
                  XML and JSON), <b>ports</b> and <b>steps</b>. Some XProc elements represent steps, others do not. (In
                  the same way as an XSLT key declaration is not a template rule.) Learning this difference among others
                  is how you learn XProc.</p>
               <p>Fortunately, the vocabulary of the language is not very large. Core XProc 3.0 has only 95 elements
                  defined in its namespace (or 99, if you are strictly counting all element types defined, not just the
                  names those elements are given). XProc 3.1 adds a few more. This includes elements for all the core
                  and community-defined steps (recognizable by the prefix <code>p:</code>). Additional to these 95 might
                  be other steps you acquire or define. As with any language, there are parts you will hardly ever use,
                  while other parts are used routinely.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <h4>XProc embedded documentation</h4>
               <p>An example of this is the XProc <code>p:documentation</code> element. This element is designed to
                  carry documentation to a consuming application. Rather than mandate some kind of behavior for
                     <code>p:documentation</code> – something difficult or impossible to do for the general case, or to
                  test –- the XProc rule is <q>anything marked as documentation is for some other consumer</q>, i.e. a
                  documentation engine, not the XProc processor. In other words, a conformant processor <a
                     href="https://spec.xproc.org/3.0/xproc/#documentation"><i>must ignore</i> anything it sees</a>
                  inside <code>p:documentation</code>.</p>
               <p>There is a small loophole, namely that the effect of <code>p:inline</code> for capturing XML overrides
                  this provision, so if you put <code>p:documentation</code> inside <code>p:inline</code>, it <q>becomes
                     visible</q> as inline content, not as XProc to be operated on (or not).</p>
               <p>As always it is up to the developer how thoroughly and in what form to include inline documentation.
                  And short of managing a corpus of code documentation along with the code, placing explanatory remarks
                  and code snippets into comments is a widely followed practice, and recommended for its combination of
                  ease and usefulness.</p>
            </section>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h3>Atomic and compound steps</h3>
            <p>Given an understanding of the organization of an XProc pipeline, the focus shifts to the steps
               themselves, which follow a common pattern. Briefly put, an atomic step is any step you use by simply
               invoking it with inputs and options: its logic is self-contained, and the operation it carries out is (at
               least conceptually) <q>single</q> and unified. A compound step, in contrast, combines one or more other
               steps in a <em>subpipeline</em> and manages these together through a single interface.</p>
            <p>XProc keeps things workable by providing only a few compound steps supporting the identified range of
               needs. This does not prove to be a practical limitation, since all steps including atomic steps can have
               multiple inputs and outputs, distinguished by type and role. (For example, a validation step might output
               both a copy of the input, potentially annotated, along with a validation report.) Atomic steps are not
               necessarily simple, and may include compound steps in their own subpipelines, either externally or even
               within the same step declaration. Accordingly, compound steps are not necessarily more complex than
               atomic steps: they are useful because they handle common contingencies such as splicing (with
                  <code>p:viewport</code>), splitting (with <code>p:for-each</code>, perform an operation in parallel
               over a set of inputs, not a single document), conditionals (<code>p:if</code>, <code>p:choose</code>) and
               exception handling (<code>p:try</code> with <code>p:catch</code> and <code>p:finally</code>).</p>
            <p>Here are all the compound steps. All others are atomic steps.</p>

            <h3>Namespaces and extension steps</h3>
            <p>We recognize steps because we either recognize them by name - for standard steps in the <code>p:</code>
               (XProc) namespace such as <code>p:filter</code> and <code>p:add-attribute</code> - or sometimes by
               process of elimination – because they cannot be anything else. This is because extension steps, whether
               written or acquired, can be named anything. Fortunately, extension steps in XProc take the form of
               elements in an <em>extension namespace</em>. Generally speaking, that is, any element not prefixed with
                  <code>p:</code> is treated as out of scope for XProc and to be ignored, while subject to evaluation as
               an extension.</p>
            <p>But this is an important category, since such extensions may include XProc steps whose functioning is
               core to the pipeline as a whole.</p>
            <details><summary>Question: Where are extension steps used in the XProcs run so far?</summary><p>One answer:
                  The <a href="./../../../smoketest/TEST-XSPEC.xpl">XSpec smoke test</a> calls an extension step named
                     <code>ox:execute-xspec</code>, defined in an imported pipeline. In this document, the prefix
                     <code>ox</code> is bound to a utility namespace,
                  <code>http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal-xproc3</code>.</p><p>In an XProc pipeline (library or step
                  declaration) one may also see additional namespaces, including</p><ul>
                  <li>The namespaces needed for XSLT, XSD, or other supported technology</li>
                  <li>One or more namespaces deployed by the XProc author to support either steps or internal operations
                     (for example, XSLT functions)</li>
                  <li>The namespace <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc-step</code>, usually associated with the name
                     prefix <code>c:</code>. This namespace is designated by XProc in order to help standardize the
                     interfaces (inputs and outputs) supported by standard steps.</li>
                  <li>The namespace <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc-error</code>, for XProc's error reporting</li>
               </ul>These declarations (often but not always at the top of the document) are critically important for
               XPath and hence for the correct operation of your pipelines. See <a
                  href="https://spec.xproc.org/3.0/xproc/#namespaces">the specification</a> for more

         <h2>Some breaking and making</h2>
         <p>Every project you examine provides an opportunity to alter pipelines and see how they fail when not encoded
            correctly – when <q>broken</q>, any way we can think of breaking them. Then build good habits by repairing
            the damage. Experiment and observation bring learning.</p>
         <p>After reading this page, perform some disassembly / reassembly. Here are a few ideas:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Switch out the value of an <code>@href</code> on a <code>p:document</code> or <code>p:load</code> step.
               See what happens when the file it points to is not actually there.</li>
            <li>There is a difference between <code>p:input</code>, used to configure a pipeline in its prologue, and
                  <code>p:load</code>, a step that loads data. Ponder what these differences are. Try changing a
               pipeline that uses one into a pipeline that uses the other.</li>
            <li>Similarly, there is a difference between a <code>p:output</code> configuration for a pipeline, and a
                  <code>p:store</code> step executed by that pipeline. Consider this difference and how we might define
               a rule for when to prefer one or the other. How is the pipeline used - is it called directly, or intended
               for use as a step in other pipelines? How is it to be controlled at runtime?</li>
            <li>Try inserting <code>p:store</code> steps into a pipeline to capture intermediate results, that is, the
               output of any step before they are processed by the next step. Such steps can aid in debugging, among
               other uses.</li>
            <li><code>@message</code> attributes on steps provide messages for the runtime traceback. They are optional
               but this repo follows a rule that any <code>p:load</code> or <code>p:store</code> should be provided with
               a message. Why?</li>
            <li>A <code>p:identity</code> step passes its input unchanged to the next step. But can also be provided
               with a <code>@message</code>.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>After breaking anything, restore it to working order. Create modified copies of any pipelines for further
            analysis and discussion.</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Concept: copy and change one of the pipelines provided to acquire a software library or resource of your
               choice.</li>
         </ul>
