      <h1>350: Namespaces in XML and XProc</h1>
      <section>
         <h2>Goals</h2>
         <p>Learn enough about namespaces in XML to be able to make sense of XProc's handling of embedded vocabularies,
            whether extending its capabilities or for the purpose of embedding (literal) data sets.</p>
         <p>Become comfortable with prefixed names such as <code>p:sleep</code>, <code>xsl:template</code> or
               <code>ox:oscal-xml-as-json</code> as a technology-wide convention for helping to disambiguate the
            semantics of different vocabularies, when mixed and in general.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
         <p>None. If you don't need to know about XML's namespace mechanism, you can gladly skip this coverage.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Resources</h2>
         <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names">Namespaces in XML Recommendation</a> was published by W3C
            in 2009, and remains the authoritative source.</p>
         <p><a href="../../worksheets/NAMESPACE_worksheet.xpl">A namespaces worksheet XProc</a>provides a place to
            experiment with namespaces in XProc.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>XML and namespaces</h2>
         <p>XProc like many XML technologies uses the XML namespace mechanism to disambiguate between mixed
            vocabularies.</p>
         <p>Using namespace-qualified names in the form of <em>colonized names</em> (such as <code>p:try</code>)  makes
            it possible to distinguish between <code>p:try</code> and <code>xsl:try</code> reliably (to use a real
            example).</p>
         <p>Moreover, a formal mechanism defined in XML syntax (<em>namespace declaration</em> by way of attributes)
            enables associating the prefixes in a given scope with a controlled set of authority references (in the form
            of namespace URIs). Thus any namespace, considered as set of prefixed names under by a given declaration)
            can easily with its putative owner, proprietor or maintainer, in a way that lets them decide the fine
            distinctions: so <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform</code> for XSLT,
               <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc</code> for XProc and so forth: same maintainance umbrella, different
            applications.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Namespace fixup and namespace cleanup steps</h2>
         <p>Because they are heavily used in XSD and XPath for data typing, in XPath, XSLT and XQuery for extension
            functionality, XProc itself, and all its XML-based inputs and outputs, namespaces are inescapable – and they
            can be messy.</p>
         <p>To help, XProc specifies a process called <em>namespace fixup</em> that constitutes essentially a set of
            rewrite rules for a tree of elements and attributes with qualified names, in order to normalize and
            streamline the deployment of namespaces, with benefits in file size and legibility. You should think of
            namespace fixup as something the processor might do on your behalf at any time, and a good thing. Minimize
            its impacts by avoiding new namespaces where possible, and controlling namespaces in use.</p>
         <p>While namespace fixup will help, it cannot optimize for your case. The step <code>p:delete-namespace</code>
            is a common remedy for <em>inflamed namespaces</em>, a condition that happens to XML that has been handled
            recklessly by too many handlers with too many namespaces. Also, <code>p:namespace-rename</code>.</p>

         <h2>Namespace tips and tricks</h2>
         <p>A few small points to make namespace handling easier.</p>
         <section>
            <h3>Steps for namespaces</h3>
            <p>In addition to the built-in namespace fixup, two XProc steps are invaluable for managing namespaces:</p>
            <ul>
               <li><a href="https://spec.xproc.org/3.0/steps/#c.namespace-delete">p:namespace-delete</a></li>
               <li><a href="https://spec.xproc.org/3.0/steps/#c.namespace-rename">p:namespace-rename</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>A couple of things to note about these:</p>
            <section>
               <h4>Namespace prefixes</h4>
               <p>XProc typically uses the namespace prefixes declared in the XProc XML file, in order to address
                  namespaces. So <code>p:namespace-delete prefixes="ox"</code> will delete whatever namespace is bound
                  by the XProc itself to the prefix <code>ox</code> – it is a feature, not a bug, that this namespace
                  (it would be <code>http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal-xproc3</code> in this repository) might be prefixed
                  differently in out-of-line XML.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <h4>Greedy renaming</h4>
               <p>When using <code>p:namespace-rename</code> you need to be careful to rename (by changing their
                  namespaces) only the nodes you want! Typically this means you will need
                     <code>apply-to="elements"</code> to prevent attributes as well as XML elements from being assigned
                  to the namespace. This is a subtle difference, but it can affect both XPath matching and schema
                  validation – and resulting problems can be hard to debug.</p>

         <section>
            <h3>Coining new namespaces</h3>
            <p>Do not be misled by the fact that namespaces are defined by means of URIs. The URIs point to pages that
               often do not exist. Making new namespaces to provide a rational scope for a new set of elements or
               functions is normal, and nothing needs to appear at that URI.</p>
            <p>Developers may have non-technical reasons for using or avoiding certain URIs when doing so, but creating
               new XML namespaces is something that simply has to be done, if we are to use them as intended and
               consistently.</p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h3>On-the-fly namespace declarations</h3>
            <p>When doing so, or when deploying any namespace declarations (the HTML namespace
                  <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code> is a frequent offender), the associated <code>xmlns:</code>
               attribute does <i>not</i> have to be placed only at the document root. Pipelines in the repository
               sometimes show namespaces declared internally, since it can be convenient to limit their scope of
               application.</p>
            <p><b>Tip:</b> try using <code>p:group</code> as a handy way of managing scoping of XML namespaces as well
               as XProc variables.</p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h3>Overloading prefixes</h3>
            <p>One problem presented by namespaces is the flip side of one of their most important features, that
               prefixes can be bound to names dynamically.</p>
            <p>Consider this XML start tag for an XProc pipeline:</p>
            <pre>&lt;p:declare-step xmlns:p="http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc" version="3.0"
   xmlns:ox="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal-xproc3"
   xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal-xproc3"
   xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
   xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
   type="ox:a-step" name="a-step"></pre>
            <p>Within the scope of this element, both unprefixed names such as <code>div</code> or <code>p</code> will
               identify the same elements as <code>ox:div</code> and <code>ox:p</code>. None of these elements are the
               familiar HTML <code>div</code> and <code>p</code> since the namespace is wrong – for HTML we would expect
               the HTML namespace, or none.</p>
            <p>This pipeline might wish to scrub its namespaces with a <a
                  href="https://spec.xproc.org/3.0/steps/#c.namespace-delete">p:namespace-delete</a> XProc step. Without
               such cleanup, since declarations are provided for the XSLT and XSD namespaces, these will accordingly
               appear (and be propagated) into literal elements given in the pipeline and hence, pipeline results.</p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h3>Matching with namespace wildcard</h3>
            <p>In XPath since version 2.0, <code>*:p</code> will identify any <code>p</code> element in any namespace –
               not always pretty, but useful.</p>
