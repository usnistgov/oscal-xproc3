      <h1>Practicum: Learn by Teaching</h1>
      <section>
         <h2>Goals</h2>
         <p>Help your team and allies.</p>
         <p>Produce a useful spin-off from a task or problem you need to master anyway.</p>
         <p>Learn not only by doing but by writing it down for yourself and others</p>
      </section>

         <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
         <p>Those with no prior experience in XSLT or declarative markup might think about that before venturing into
            these waters. This is an awesome exercise but you can't really fake it.</p>
         <p>Of course there is no rule that says you have to share your results. As always you are welcome to explore
            with no prior commitments, and if writing a lesson plan for no one is useful to you, go for it.</p>

            <li>Everything else you have seen relating to XProc</li>
            <li>Your own problems</li>

         <h2>Improve or enhance a lesson or lesson unit</h2>
         <p>Astute readers will have observed that a markup-based deployment invites editing. But the authoring or data
            acquisition model of this tutorial is not Markdown-based - Markdown is paradoxically not used for its
            intended purpose but as one of several <b>publication</b> formats for this data set, which is currently
            written in an XML-based HTML5 tag set defined for the project. By writing, querying and indexing in XHTML we
            can use XProc from the start. Extensibility and flexibility in publication is one of the strengths - to
            publish a new or rearranged tutorial sequence can be done with a few lines and commands. A drag and drop
            interface supporting XProc makes this even easier, while it is already installed and running under CI/CD,
            meaning both editorial and code quality checks can be done with every commit.</p>
         <p>Improving a page is as simple as editing the copy found in XXX and XXX</p>
         <p>Making and deploying a new pages is a little harder: XXX</p>
