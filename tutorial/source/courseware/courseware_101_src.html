      <h1>Courseware 101: Producing this tutorial</h1>
      <section>
         <h2>Goals</h2>
         <p>Understand better how this tutorial is produced.</p>
         <p>See an example of a small but lightweight and scalable publishing system can be implemented in XProc and
            XSLT.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
         <p>None.</p>
         <p>Readers who wish not only to inspect and refresh tutorial contents, but also to edit or extend, or alter the
            tutorial pipelines, are invited to look at <a href="courseware_219_src.html" class="LessonUnit">the next
               exercise (lesson unit)</a>.</p>

         <h2>Tutorial production pipelines</h2>
         <p>The source files for these tutorials are all stored in the repository in <a href="../">a directory named
                  <code>source</code></a>, and maintained in HTML format. The expectation is that all files will be
            represented as valid and complete HTML 5 in XML syntax, i.e. XHTML to be treated as an HTML document type.
            When composing the tutorial lessons, the author uses XML-based tools this rule (and others). However, not
            all files in this subdirectory are used as source materials; this is only where they are stored and
            maintained. Draft materials might appear here as well.</p>
         <p>At the top of the tutorial structure, a file <a href="../../lesson-plan.xml">lesson-plan.xml</a> is used as
            a publication driver or configuration file, when read (by means of XProc) as a sequence of links back to
            folders. Production is achieved by running pipelines that traverse the links, reading files and working
            appropriately. Each folder named as a <code>Lesson/@key</code> is read, with all HTML files surnamed
               <code>_src.html</code> from that folder considered to be tutorial source materials, in nominally
            alphabetic order. The tutorial as a whole is built by reading each of these files, converting it to Markdown
            (with adjustments), and producing indexes to the entire set, all done by writing files into the <a
               href="sequence/">sequence directory</a>. Such a Markdown file set can be read and edited in Github in the
            usual way, or refreshed by running a production pipeline again.</p>
         <p>The authoring model and its design rationales as well as its tooling support, including automated proof
            checking under CI/CD, is described in a <a href="courseware_219_src.html" class="LessonUnit">subsequent
               lesson unit</a>. Authoring in HTML rather than Markdown provides all kinds of leverage for ad-hoc
               <q>tutorial semantics</q> especially with the help of a structured (tagless) editor.</p>
         <p>Each of the pipelines described here performs a specific task with respect to tutorial production, except
            for one, a convenience or utility pipeline that runs all the others with a single invocation.</p>
         <p>As always, pipelines should be provided internally with explanatory comments.</p>
         <p>When reading and writing files to file systems, the usual security considerations apply.</p>
