         <h2>Goals</h2>
         <p>Help yourself, your team and allies.</p>
         <p>Produce a useful spin-off from a task or problem you need to master anyway.</p>
         <p>Learn not only by doing but by writing it down for yourself and others.</p>

         <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
         <p>Those with no prior experience in XSLT or declarative markup might think about that before venturing into
            these waters. This is an awesome exercise but faking it takes you only so far. This lesson segment assumes
            you will write content in HTML as well as giving you the chance to extend XProc and XSLT as you see fit.</p>
         <p>Writing HTML by hand can be arduous; accordingly, for producing tutorial pages we have used a structured XML
            authoring environment (oXygen XML Author) with many features including styling in display; full control over
            styling; Schematron rules in the background along with UI support for content corrections according to those
            rules; etc. oXygen Author or its functional equivalent is highly recommended.</p>
         <p>However, any text editor or programmers' coding environment also works (to whatever extent generic HTML is
            supported), and Schematrons applied to HTML files can be run in XProc (as described).</p>

         <h2>Improve or enhance a lesson or lesson unit</h2>
         <p>Alert readers will have observed that a Markdown-based deployment invites editing. But the authoring or data
            acquisition model of this tutorial is not Markdown-based - Markdown is paradoxically not used for its usual
            purpose, but as one of several publication formats for this data set, which is currently written in an
            XML-based HTML5 tag set defined for the project. By writing, querying and indexing in XHTML we can use XProc
            from the start. The HTML dialect means things mostly <q>just work</q> using HTML tools such as web browsers,
            while we have transformations (provided in pipelines) to render into any other publication format we may
            happen to need: Markdown being only one of a range of choices.</p>
         <p>Extensibility and flexibility is one of the strengths of this approach: to publish a new or rearranged
            tutorial sequence can be done with a few lines and commands. A drag and drop interface supporting XProc
            makes this even easier, while again XProc is already supported under CI/CD, meaning both editorial and code
            quality checks can be done with every commit by simply listing the appropriate pipeline with others.</p>
         <p>The workflow supporting this publication model is simple. A set of lessons (lesson units) is gathered
            together in a single folder. That folder is listed in <a href="../../lesson-plan.xml">a directory file</a>.
            To publish the tutorial, an XProc pipeline is executed that polls these directories and produces Markdown
            files corresponding to the inputs, only in a new sequence with links rewritten. Other pipelines can be run
            to update the directory to lesson units and other higher-level production such as a single-page HTML reading
            preview version. See <a href="courseware_101_src.html" class="LessonUnit">the earlier treatment</a> for more
            details.</p>
         <p>Improving a page is as simple as editing the HTML source in the folder. Adding a page is as simple as
            copying and altering a page in place, and seeing to it the new page is valid to both HTML5 and project
            requirements.</p>

            <h3>Apply Schematron to your edits</h3>
            <p><a href="../../src/lesson-html.sch">A Schematron for lesson unit files</a> also ensures that links are in
               place and project conventions are observed.</p>
            <p>You will be grateful to do this interactively in an editor that supports Schematron in the
               background.</p>

         <h2>Create a new lesson unit (<q>area</q>)</h2>
         <p>Create a new folder and add it to <a href="../../lesson-plan.xml">the tutorial lesson plan XML</a>.</p>
         <p>When production pipelines are run, all HTML files present in the newly-listed folders will be included to
            the tutorial as lesson units. Within the folder they will be listed alphabetically. Be sure that your new
            HTML is also Schematron-valid.</p>

         <h2>Produce a new project and document it with a tutorial</h2>
         <p>You could make a new lesson topic with lessons on your own new project.</p>
         <p>This repository is provided with a <a href="../../../project-template/readme.md">project template</a> to
            make it easier to get started with new pipelines for new applications. Start a new project by copying this
            folder into the <code>projects</code> folder, renaming it, and proceeding to edit its file contents.</p>
