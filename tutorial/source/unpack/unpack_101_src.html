      <h1>101: Unpacking XProc 3.0</h1>
      <p></p>
      <section><h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>More familiarity with XProc 3.0: more syntax</li>
         <li>History, concepts and resources</li>
      </ul>
      </section>
      <section><h2>Resources</h2>
         <p>The same pipelines you ran in setup: <a href="../setup/setup_101_src.html" class="LessonUnit">Setup 101</a>.</p>
         <p>Also, <a href="https://xproc.org">XProc.org dashboard page</a></p>
         <p>Also, XProc index materials produced in this repository: <a href="../../../projects/xproc-doc/readme.md">XProc
               docs</a></p>

         <h2>A closer look</h2>
         <p>If you have completed <a href="../setup/setup_101_src.html" class="LessonUnit">Setup 102</a> you have already opened and
            inspected the pipelines in the <a href="../../../lib/readme.md">lib</a> and <a href="../../../smoketest/readme.md">smoketest</a> folders.</p>
         <p>Routine code inspection can also be done on Github as well (not a bad idea in any case), not just in a
            copy.</p>
         <p>A quick summary of what these pipelines do:</p>
            <ul>
               <li><a href="../../../lib/GRAB-SAXON.xpl">lib/GRAB-SAXON.xpl</a> downloads a zip file from a <a
                  href="https://www.saxonica.com/download">Saxonica download site</a>, saves it, and extracts a
                  <code>jar</code> (Java library) file, which it places in the Morgana library directory</li>
               <li><a href="../../../lib/GRAB-SCHXSLT.xpl">lib/GRAB-SCHXSLT.xpl</a> downloads a zip file from Github and
               unzips it into a directory where Morgana can find it.</li>
               <li><a href="../../../lib/GRAB-XSPEC.xpl">lib/GRAB-XSPEC.xpl</a> also downloads and <q>unarchives</q> a
               zip file resource, this time a copy of <a href="https://github.com/xspec/xspec">an XSpec
               distribution</a>.</li>
               </ul>
         <p>Essentially, these all replicate and capture the work a developer must do to identify and acquire libraries.
            Maintaining our dependencies this way - not quite, but almost <q>by hand</q>, -- appears to have benefits
            for system transparency and robustness.</p>
         <p>The second group of pipelines is a bit more interesting. Each of the utilities provided for in packages just
            downloaded is tested by running a smoke test.</p>
         <p>Each smoke test performs a minor task, serving as a smoke test inasmuch as its only aim is to determine
            whether a simple representative process completes successfully.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><a href="../../../smoketest/POWER-UP.xpl">smoketest/POWER-UP.xpl</a> amounts to an XProc <q>Hello
                  World</q>. In that spirit, feel free to edit and adjust.</li>
            <li><a href="../../../smoketest/SMOKETEST-XSLT.xpl">smoketest/SMOKETEST-XSLT.xpl</a> tests Saxon, an
               XSLT/XQuery transformation engine. XSLT and XQuery are related technologies (different languages, same
               data model) developed with XML processing in mind, but in recent years generalized to a wider range of
               data structures.</li>
               <li><a href="../../../smoketest/SMOKETEST-SCHEMATRON.xpl">smoketest/SMOKETEST-SCHEMATRON.xpl</a> tests
               SchXSLT. SchXSLT is an implementation of Schematron, an ISO-standard validation and reporting technology.
               Schematron relies on XSLT, so this library requires Saxon.</li>
               <li><a href="../../../smoketest/SMOKETEST-XSPEC.xpl">smoketest/SMOKETEST-XSPEC.xpl</a> tests XSpec, an
               XSLT-based testing framework useful for testing deployments of XSLT, XQuery and Schematron.</li>
            </ul>
         <p>All these together comprise more than can be learned in an afternoon, or even a week.</p>
         <p>At the same time, common foundations make it possible to learn these technologies together and in
            tandem.</p>
         <p>In particular, they all share a syntax for interrogating (querying) the structure of an XML document and
            returning its data: the XPath expression language.</p>

         <h2>Learning about XProc</h2>
         <p>This tutorial has as handmade<a href="../../xproc-dashboard.md">XProc
               dashboard page</a> with links.</p>
         <p>Also, the official <a href="https://xproc.org">XProc.org dashboard page</a>.</p>
         <p>Also, check out XProc index materials (with code snips) produced in this repository: <a
               href="../../../projects/xproc-doc/readme.md">XProc docs</a>. Produced using XProc, these
            can be covered in detail in a later lesson unit.</p>
         <p>There is <a href="https://xmlpress.net/publications/xproc-3-0/">a book, Erik Siegel's <i>XProc 3.0
                  Programmer's Reference</i></a> (2020).</p>
