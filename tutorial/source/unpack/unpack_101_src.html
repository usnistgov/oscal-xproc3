         <h2>A closer look</h2>
         <p>If you have completed <a href="../setup/setup_101_src.html" class="LessonUnit">Setup 102</a> you have
            already inspected the <a href="../../../lib/readme.md">lib</a> and <a href="../../../smoketest/readme.md"
               >smoketest</a> folders, and run pipelines you have found there. If you haven't, now is the moment to
            catch up.</p>
         <p>Routine code inspection can also be done on Github as well (not a bad idea in any case), not just in a copy
            of the distribution.</p>
         <p>A quick summary of what these pipelines do:</p>
         <ul>
            <li><a href="../../../lib/GRAB-SAXON.xpl">lib/GRAB-SAXON.xpl</a> downloads a zip file from a <a
                  href="https://www.saxonica.com/download">Saxonica download site</a>, saves it, and extracts a
                  <code>jar</code> (Java library) file, which it places in the Morgana library directory</li>
            <li><a href="../../../lib/GRAB-SCHXSLT.xpl">lib/GRAB-SCHXSLT.xpl</a> downloads a zip file from Github and
               unzips it into a directory where Morgana can find it.</li>
            <li><a href="../../../lib/GRAB-XSPEC.xpl">lib/GRAB-XSPEC.xpl</a> also downloads and <q>unarchives</q> a zip
               file resource, this time a copy of <a href="https://github.com/xspec/xspec">an XSpec
               distribution</a>.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Essentially, these all replicate and capture the work a developer must do to identify and acquire libraries.
            Maintaining our dependencies this way - not quite, but almost <q>by hand</q> -- appears to have benefits for
            system transparency and robustness.</p>
         <p>The second group of pipelines is a bit more interesting. Each of the utilities provided for in packages just
            downloaded is tested by running a smoke test.</p>
         <p>Each smoke test performs a minor task, serving as a <q>smoke test</q> inasmuch as its only aim is to
            determine whether a simple representative process completes successfully. (When we plug in the board, can we
            see and smell smoke?)</p>
         <ul>
            <li><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XPROC3.xpl">smoketest/TEST-XPROC3.xpl</a> amounts to an XProc <q>Hello
                  World</q>. In that spirit, feel free to write your own version.</li>
            <li><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XSLT.xpl">smoketest/TEST-XSLT.xpl</a> tests Saxon, an XSLT/XQuery
               transformation engine. XSLT and XQuery are related technologies (different languages, same data model)
               developed with XML processing in mind, but in recent years generalized to a wider range of data
               structures.</li>
            <li><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-SCHEMATRON.xpl">smoketest/TEST-SCHEMATRON.xpl</a> tests SchXSLT.
               SchXSLT is an implementation of Schematron, an ISO-standard validation and reporting technology. As this
               implementation relies on XSLT, this library also requires Saxon.</li>
            <li><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XSPEC.xpl">smoketest/TEST-XSPEC.xpl</a> tests XSpec, an XSLT-based
               testing framework useful for testing deployments of XSLT, XQuery and Schematron.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Any and each of these can be used as a <q>black box</q> by any competent operator, even without
            understanding the internals. But this simplicity masks and manages complexity. XProc is XProc but its
            capabilities are limited without XSLT, XQuery, Schematron, XSpec and others, an open-ended set of compatible
            and complimentary technologies.</p>
         <p>At the same time, common foundations make it possible to learn these technologies together and in
            tandem.</p>

         <h2>Walkthrough</h2>
         <p>Each of the test pipelines exercises a simple sequence of operations. Open the XSpec file in an editor or
            viewer where you can see the tags.</p>
         <section>
            <h3>TEST-XPROC3</h3>
            <p>Examine the pipeline <a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XPROC3.xpl">TEST-XPROC3.xpl</a>. It breaks down as
               follows:</p>
            <ul>
               <li><code>p:output</code> – An <em>output port</em> is defined. It specifies that when the process
                  results are delivered, a couple of serialization rules are followed: the text is indented and written
                  without an XML declaration at the top. With this port, the process outputs can be captured by the
                  calling process (such as your script), or simply echoed to the console.</li>
               <li><code>p:identity</code> – An <em>identity step</em> does nothing with its input but simply passes it
                  along. This one is a little different from usual in that its inputs are given as literal (XML)
                  contents in the pipeline. Essentially, because this pipeline has this step, it does not need to load
                  or rely on any inputs, because its inputs are given here. The input is a single line of XML.</li>
               <li><code>p:namespace-delete</code> – A <em>namespace-delete</em> step is used to strip an XML namespace
                  definition from the document bound to the identity step. This XML inherits namespaces from the
                  pipeline itself, but it has no elements or attributes that use it, so the namespace is unneeded and
                  its declaration comes through as noise. With this step the pipeline results are clean and simple.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you run this pipeline, the <code>CONGRATULATIONS</code> document given in line will be echoed to the
               console, where designated outputs will appear if not otherwise directed.</p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h3>TEST-XSLT</h3>
            <p><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XSLT.xpl">This pipeline</a> executes a simple XSLT transformation, in
               order to test that XSLT transformations can be successfully executed.</p>
            <ul>
               <li><code>p:output</code> – An output port is designated with <code>p:output</code> as in the <a
                     href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XPROC3.xpl">TEST-XPROC3 pipeline</a>.</li>
               <li><code>p:xslt</code> – Instead of providing a literal document in an <em>identity</em> step, this
                  pipeline performs an XSLT transformation. The input to this transformation is given as a literal XML
                  in the same way, except this time it is provided as input to a transformation process defined by an <a
                     href="../../../smoketest/src/congratulations.xsl">XSLT stylesheet</a> called in by the
                  pipeline.</li>
               <li><code>p:namespace-delete</code> – The <code>ox</code> namespace is stripped from the result as in <a
                     href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XPROC3.xpl">TEST-XPROC3 pipeline</a>. This could have been done in
                  the XSLT as well, but this way the transformation has one less thing to do or go wrong. More simpler
                  steps prove more legible and tractable than fewer complicated ones.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Like the <a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XPROC3.xpl">TEST-XPROC3 pipeline</a> this pipeline shows its
               results in the console. This time the result is not just the XML given in the pipeline, but that XML as
               modified by the transformation.</p>
            <p>If your pipeline execution can't process the XSLT (perhaps Saxon is not installed, or the XSLT itself has
               a problem) you will get an error to say so.</p>
            <p>Errors in XProc are reported by the Morgana engine using XML syntax. Among other things, this means they
               can be captured and processed in pipelines.</p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h3>TEST-SCHEMATRON</h3>
            <p>Schematron is a language used to specify rules to apply to XML documents. In this case a small Schematron
               is applied to a small XML.</p>
            <ul>
               <li><code>p:output</code> – An output port is designated for the results with the same settings.</li>
               <li><code>p:validate-with-schematron</code> – This is an XProc step specifically for evaluating an XML
                  document against the rules of a given Schematron. Like the TEST-XPROC3 and TEST-XSLT` pipelines, this
                  one presents its own input, given as a literal XML document given in the pipeline document (using
                     <code>p:inline</code>). A setting on this step provides for it to throw an error if the document
                  does not conform to the rules. The Schematron file provided as input to this step, <a
                     href="../../../smoketest/src/doing-well.sch">src/doing-well.sch</a>, gives the rules. This flexible
                  technology enables easy testing of XML against rule sets defined either for particular cases in
                  particular workflows, or for entire classes or sets of documents.</li>
               <li><code>p:namespace-delete</code> – This step is used here as in the other tests for final cleanup of
                  the information produced.</li>
            </ul>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h3>TEST-XSPEC</h3>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/xspec/xspec">XSpec</a> is a testing framework for XSLT, XQuery and
               Schematron. It takes the form of a vocabulary and a process (inevitably implemented in XSLT and XQuery)
               for executing queries, transformations, and validations, by running them over known inputs, comparing the
               results to expected results, and reporting the results of this comparison. XProc, built to orchestrate
               manipulations of XML contents, is well suited for running XSpec.</p>
            <p>An XSpec instance (or <q>document</q>) defines a set of tests for a transformation or query module using
               the XSpec vocabulary. An XSpec implementation executes the tests and delivers the results. Since XSpec,
               like Schematron, reports its findings in XML, XProc can be useful both to manage the inputs and outputs,
               and to process the XSpec reports.</p>
            <ul>
               <li><code>p:import</code> – calls to an external XProc file to make its step definitions available.</li>
               <li><code>p:input</code> – works as it does elsewhere, to declare inputs for the pipeline. In this case,
                  the inputs must be XSpec documents using the XSpec vocabulary. You can expect errors when they are
                  not. This testing pipeline offers three different XSpecs to be run, one each for XSLT, XQuery and
                  Schematron.</li>
               <li><code>p:for-each</code> – defines a step or sequence of steps to be applied to each input,
                  separately.</li>
               <li><code>p:identity</code> – simply passes through the previous step's result. While this is a
                     <q>no-op</q> in the XProc itself, it provides an occasion for a message to help trace the XProc
                  execution.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><a href="unpack_102_src.html" class="LessonUnit">The next lesson</a> offers more detail about this
               pipeline.</p>
         </section>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>A not-so-simple pipeline</h2>
         <p><b>tl/dr</b> - examine the Markdown file presenting <a href="../../sequence/element-directory.md">XProc
               Element directory</a>. It is generated by <a href="../../PRODUCE-PROJECTS-ELEMENTLIST.xpl">a
            pipeline</a>. Examine that pipeline to see XProc with real-world complexity.</p>
         <p>The simple pipelines examined so far show how useful things can be done simply, while the pipeline
            architecture allows for great flexibility.</p>
         <p>Simplicity and flexibility together enable complexity. Once it is factored out, a complex operation can be
            managed and deployed just like a simple one, with its internal complexities masked by a simple and
            predictable interface.</p>
         <p>One other important feature of XProc must be kept in mind: so far at least, it is all XML. We haven't seen
            pipelines that work directly with XML data yet, much, except in the most rudimentary form (the smoke tests).
            But most of the time that is what XProc is for. Moreover, XProc is itself in XML syntax, which makes it
            possible to work XProc with XProc. XProc folding over on itself. Even short of of dynamically generating and
            executing XProc (and yes that is a thing), the common ground of XML format means that with XProc working XML
            tools, XML is always available as a force magnifier or power tool, something we can put to work again and
            again. In XProc, errors are reported in XML. So we can capture, aggregate and index error messages in XProc.
            In XProc, a directory file listing is provided in XML. So we have a ready way to present views of file
            systems – the XML shows all the names and structures – as well as analyze them and access the files in them.
            Etc.</p>
         <p>Next, take a look at a more complex example, the prototype pipeline <a
               href="../../PRODUCE-PROJECTS-ELEMENTLIST.xpl">PRODUCE-PROJECTS-ELEMENTLIST.xpl</a>. Like the setup and
            smoke-test pipelines, this is a standalone pipeline: it acquires inputs, produces results and writes those
            results to the file system. The output it generates is stored as <a
               href="../../sequence/element-directory.md">element-directory.md</a>, a Markdown file (find the
               <code>p:store</code> step).</p>
         <p>The result is a reference resource: an index of XProc elements used in pipelines described in this tutorial.
            For any XProc element used anywhere, the listing shows the pipelines where it appears. It also shows a list
            of project folders in the order they are treated by this tutorial, their XProc files and with these, with
            whatever XProc elements appear <i>first</i> (within the tutorial sequence) within that file. (Among other
            uses this is helpful for assessing coverage of lessons.)</p>
         <p>For example, looking up <code>p:store</code> you can see all the pipelines that contain this common step. Or
            looking at the <code>oscal-convert</code> listing you can see the XProc steps introduced in that lesson.</p>
         <p>Delete or rename this result file and run the pipeline to confirm it functions properly.</p>
         <p>Consider also what other kinds of indexing might be useful. When you modify XProc or add new XProc pipelines
            to the project folders, consider running this pipeline again to update the indexes.</p>
         <p>Open the file and inspect it to get a sense of what it does. The XML syntax is verbose, but not really all
            that frightening. The pipeline is described in more detail in the <a href="unpack_102_src.html"
               class="LessonUnit">102 Lesson unit</a> segment.</p>
         <section>
            <h3>PRODUCE-PROJECTS-ELEMENTLIST</h3>
            <p>The pipeline <a href="../../PRODUCE-PROJECTS-ELEMENTLIST.xpl">PRODUCE-PROJECTS-ELEMENTLIST.xpl</a>
               contains comments that should help explain its operations.</p>
            <p>There are some significant differences between this pipeline and the small ones we have looked at so
               far.</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Of course, it is longer and more complex, reflecting the complexity of the operations it
                  performs.</li>
               <li>Part of the complexity is due to a two-step process here. First, the file system is surveyed in
                  locations named in an input configuration. Then all those resources (which happen to be XML using the
                  XProc vocabulary) are indexed against the files in which they occur.</li>
               <li>In particular, the index to <q>first use</q> is not simple. A great deal of the complexity of
                  detailed operations has been off-loaded into XSLT transformation code, which in this pipeline can be
                  seen embedded in the XProc, indeed occupying a significant majority of the XML in the file. (About two
                  thirds of the element count you can usually recognize XSLT by the conventional <code>xsl:</code> or
                     <code>xslt:</code> element prefix.) This pipeline also has one XSLT called from an external file,
                  toward the end. XProc can do it either way, and each has its advantages.</li>
               <li>One good thing about seeing the XSLT here is you can get a good sense of what it looks like, whether
                  embedded or kept externally.</li>
            </ul>

         <h2>XML syntax, XPath and XProc</h2>
         <p>Newcomers to XML may feel they are in the deep water with XML syntax.</p>
         <p>In the context of XProc, this is actually not as hard as it looks:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>All XML files follow the same syntax rules with respect to tags, elements and attributes (names and
               syntax), namespaces, comments etc.</li>
            <li>XML vocabularies are typically qualified with namespaces to show, and to disambiguate, which XML
               application or language they belong to. The namespaces are indicated by name <em>prefixes</em>. So in
               this repository (and conventionally for XProc), any element prefixed <code>p:</code> is an XProc element,
               and another prefix or none indicates an extension or another vocabulary, such as appears in XML being
               processed.</li>
            <li>Embedded in the syntax is another syntax, <em>XPath</em>. This lightweight but powerful query language
               is a formal subset of XQuery. XPath is ubiquitous in XProc, XSLT, Schematron, XSpec etc. In XProc, the
               XPath will ordinarily be given in attributes.</li>
            <li>Learn more about this in the <a href="unpack_102_src.html" class="LessonUnit">102 Lesson unit</a> – or
               plunge on, and pick up what you need as you go.</li>
