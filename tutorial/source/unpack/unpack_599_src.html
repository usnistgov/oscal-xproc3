      <p>More in depth.</p>
      <section><h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>More familiarity with XProc 3.0: more syntax</li>
         <li>History, concepts and resources</li>
      </ul>

      <section><h2>Resources</h2>
         <p>The same pipelines you ran in setup: <a href="../setup/setup_101_src.html">Setup 101</a>.</p>
         <p>Also, <a href="https://xproc.org">XProc.org dashboard page</a></p>

         <h2>XProc schema</h2>
      </section>
      <p>A schema for the XProc language, considered as core steps (compound and atomic) plus optional community-defined
         steps, is referenced from the XProc Specification. This RNG schema is very useful.</p>
      <p>However, for the most part it is necessary only to validate in the application, i.e. to let Morgana (in this
         case) take responsibility for this operation as it sees fit. The reference schema becomes useful if we find or
         suspect bugs in Morgana, but until then it has no direct role in any runtime operation.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless the RNG schema can still be very useful as a reference and an object for querying -- queries whose
         results tell us about XProc.</p>
      <section>
         <h2>XPath</h2>
         <p>Like other XDM-based technologies, XProc embeds and incorporates XPath, an expression language for XML.
            XPath 3.0 is a functional language in its own right, although not designed for end-to-end processing of
            encoded source data into encoded results, but only for certain critical operations that ordinarily need to
            be performed within such end-to-end processing. Since it is partial in this way, XPath is defined not in
            terms of any data notation (such as XML syntax or any other) but rather against an <i>abstract data
               object</i>, namely an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel/">XDM</a> instance (XML data model),
            a putative information object that may be provided to the system by parsing an XML (syntax) instance, or by
            other means. As the query language for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel/">XDM</a> and the
            basis for XQuery, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/">XPath</a> is the <q>other half</q> of the data
            model, which any architect of a system using this technology must know. Learning XPath equips you mentally
            for dealing with the XDM in XQuery, XSLT, XProc or anywhere you find it.</p>
         <p>For those not already familiar with XPath, on line resources can be helpful. Keep in mind that <a
               href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/">XPath 3.1</a> outstrips XPath 1.0 in many important respects.</p>

         <p>The technologies have been in constant use over this period.</p>
         <p>Historically, the requirements of processing frameworks have often been met by software developers' build
            utilities (for example, GNU <code>make</code> or Apache Ant). This is not an accident: in certain respects,
            a publishing framework can be considered as a <q>documentary build</q> at a higher level.</p>

      </ul>
      <section>The technologies we rely on share a common foundation in XML and XDM, technologies developed under the
         auspices of the World Wide Web Consortium.<p>They are commodity tools in the sense that they are freely
            available to use without restriction, an important qualification for this distribution, which <i>cannot
               endorse any particular technological solution to any problem</i>, however posed or circumscribed.
            Accordingly, solutions here are not offered as endorsements but as stipulations of (minimum) viable
            functionality in tools or capabilities, and not only using tools as <q>black boxes</q>, but under control
            and conformant to external specifications (standards).</p>Users of these tools should keep in mind the model
         whereby we imagine the viability of a tools market and ecosystem that enables both large and small software
         developers including independent developers, academic researchers, and students, to participate meaningfully,
         finding an appropriate value or service proposition to provide their long-term goals. Translated, this means
         the tools must be capable enough for industrial use at scale, while also <q>scale down</q> to demonstration or
         classroom use.</section>
      <section><p>In web standards including HTML and Javascript (ECMAScript) we arguably have the beginnings of such an
            ecosystem, while it is also contested and turbulent. Within the publishing sector more broadly and
            intersecting with the web, the XML family of standards arguably provides the best demonstration of complete
            or near-complete capabilities at least with respect to the harder problems of document processing.</p><ul>

            similar offerings.</p></section>
