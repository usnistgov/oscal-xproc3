         <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
         <p>Run the pipelines described in <a href="oscal-publish_101_src.html">the 101 Lesson</a></p>

         <h2>Resources</h2>
         <p>Like the <a href="oscal-publish_101_src.html">101 lesson</a>, this lesson unit uses the <a
               href="../../../projects/oscal-publish/readme.md">oscal-import project</a> in this repo.</p>
         <p>Publishing your own OSCAL in these pipelines is also worth trying - the worst they can do is fail. Bring
            OSCAL, especially OSCAL catalogs.</p>
         <p>OSCAL JSON catalogs can be accommodated by splicing together a conversion pipeline with a publishing
            pipeline, as described in the exercise.</p>
