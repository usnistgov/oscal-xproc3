      <h1>101: Some OSCAL publishing</h1>
      <section>
         <h2>Goals</h2>
         <p>Use XProc to produce publication artifacts such as HTML (web) pages or Markdown pages from OSCAL. Consider
            how other results and reports are created including PDF and other formats.</p>
         <p>Gain a sense of capabilities and limitations of automated ('lights-out') production of publications from
            OSCAL.</p>

         <p>This unit relies on the <a href="../../../projects/oscal-publish/readme.md">oscal-publish project</a> in
            this repository, with its files. Like other projects this one may have installation or setup pipelines to
            run.</p>
         <p>Additionally if you have your own OSCAL to <q>print</q>, especially OSCAL catalogs, bring it along.</p>
         <p><a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf">SP  800-53 rev 5
