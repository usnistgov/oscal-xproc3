         <h2>Resources</h2>
         <p>A <a href="../../worksheets/CONTENT-TYPE_worksheet.xpl">content-types worksheet XProc</a> is
            offered for trying out content-type options on XProc inputs and outputs. If you only have thirty minutes,
            consider looking at it before reading further. Your questions are more likely to be answered by a smart test
            than by consulting a commentary.</p>
         <p>The pipeline <a href="../../worksheets/READ-JSON-TESTING.xpl">READ-JSON-TESTING.xpl</a>
            provides an experimental surface for working functionality specifically related to JSON and XDM map
            objects.</p>

         <h2>XProc documents and XDM objects</h2>
         <p>In order to help mediate between these conceptions of data sets and their boundaries, XProc introduces an
            idea of <em>documents</em>, specifically associated with the concept of <em>content types</em> and with it,
            the idea of a known (i.e., relatively well defined) but open-ended, expanding set of types, as applied
            specifically to files or resources acquired using Internet protocols (URI schemes) such as <code>file</code>
            and <code>http</code> (the <a href="https://spec.xproc.org/3.0/xproc/#common-errors">two schemes most likely
               to be supported by any XProc engine</a>). On the one hand this enables XProc to align with IETF standard
            content types to take advantage of this codification and taxonomy. On the other, it permits XProc to provide
            a clean interface with the XDM data model as it is used internally.</p>
         <p>Anything in XDM, not only nominal <q>documents</q> or instances of <code>document-node(),</code> can be made
            into a document in XProc and placed in a document sequence; and any XProc document can be processed through
            an XProc pipeline. Not all documents (either as XProc documents or XDM instances) can be serialized in every
            form: but XDM now accommodates not only node trees suitable for expression as XML or HTML; its objects now
            also include maps and arrays. These in turn bring well-defined mappings from almost all of XDM's defined
            data types (apart from node types, which are ably enough serialized as XML) into JSON.</p>
         <section>
            <h3>XProc's approach to documents</h3>
            <p>The term <q>document</q> is one of those words that means differently when used across contexts as
               different-but-related as XML, XPath, XDM and XProc. A document here is not a document over there (to say
               nothing of a document node or a document type), but leave all that aside. The usefulness of the term is
               paradoxically in the fact that we do not trouble ourselves to define it formally every time - even when
               it does, in fact, have a formal definition (which possibly aligns with, or doesn't align with, other
               formal definitions). The words <q>object</q> and <q>type</q> are similarly overloaded. Because the edges
               of such words are sharp, they should be used with care.</p>
            <p>One complicating factor is that all documents in the largest and undefined sense of the term, must be in
               scope for XProc 3.0. This is a large and ultimately unmanageable requirement, even if it includes only
                  <i>digital</i> representations, surrogates or versions of what we call <q>documents</q>. At the same
               time, the universe of (digital) documents is not entirely incoherent or unknown. XProc deals with this
               strategic challenge by dividing document-space, like Gaul, into three parts:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>XML or things similar enough to XML to be treated like it (including HTML)</li>
               <li>Alternative non-XML serialization formats for structured and unstructured data / objects, including
                  JSON, but also other text-based formats</li>
               <li>Everything else, such as binaries or encodings that can't be read as or mapped to Unicode</li>
            </ul>
            <p>How XProc deals with each of these depends on its category.</p>
            <p>Because the three categories together encompass the full range of digital information types (an
               anything-else category helps alot), this approach essentially permits XProc to divide and conquer.</p>
            <section>
               <h4>XML and the XML-like</h4>
               <p>Because XProc is an XML-native technology, this is an easy lift.</p>
               <p>XML parsers are available that can render XML into XDM element trees (<q>documents</q>). For formats
                  like HTML, which is close to XML but which, for historic reasons, requires a parser or handler of its
                  own, it can still be regarded as XML-like inasmuch as we can build an XDM element tree - much like an
                  HTML DOM - reliably from such an instance.</p>
               <p>If your XProc engine has any idea that a file is XML, it can pick it up and deal with it meaningfully.
                  Because HTML is so widespread, expect most XProc engines to parse HTML as well. XML and HTML together,
                  with all their types, subtypes and application profiles together, is quite a wide range.</p>
               <p>Since you can make it up on the fly, XML also makes a good internal or intermediary format for any
                  kind of pipelining process. This includes HTML-flavored XML, when it is useful to have it.</p>
               <p>The XProc media types </p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <h4>JSON and plain text-based formats</h4>
               <p>Formats that are either UTF-8, or can be rendered as UTF-8 by virtue of Unicode compatibility (with
                  appropriate tools and transcoding), can be read as plain text.</p>
               <p>Incidentally – and by design – one text-based format has a special property that gives XProc extra
                     <q>hooks</q> for rendering it, namely that form of text (data serialization) known as JSON.
                  Designed to represent a subset of Javascript-native object types, JSON has the advantage today of
                  ubiquity. Fortunately its notational conventions have also been adopted by XPath, to the extent that
                  within an XPath or XDM operational context, JSON can be regarded as a functional subset of XDM
                     <em>map</em> objects, which share the basic architecture (objects with properties in the form of
                  sets of name/value pairs, where property names are all distinct).</p>
               <p>This makes it much easier because it means that in general, JSON can be handled by the same rules we
                  have for XDM outside the XML <q>inner zone</q> of element trees – i.e. XDM objects that, because they
                  are either simple or complex entities with semantics of their own (as <em>typed objects</em>), do not
                  readily find expression as XML element serializations, i.e. tags and text. In other words, the problem
                  of JSON is solved with a general solution of how to serialize any XDM.</p>
               <p>Indeed, this subsumption of JSON object types into XDM offers that same solution by inverting it -
                  given any arbitrary XDM value or sequence of values, what can we make of it if XML tags are not
                  predetermined for it? By definition a lone XDM string or <code>xs:dateTime</code> object does not have
                  a well-defined XML-based equivalent, even if (such as in the case of the date-time objects) some
                  semantics come with the definition. But we can more or less readily make JSON objects out of them, if
                  only strings.</p>
               <p>So XProc has a kind of escape hatch for XDM objects that are not easily cast to XML documents. They
                  can be handled as documents in a broader XProc sense if we can treat them as
                     <code>content-type="application/json"</code>. And this in turn gives us a working surface from
                  which we can develop other representations. As always your mileage may vary.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <h4>Not XML, not text-based</h4>
               <p>Binaries inevitably make a grab-bag anything-else category, because not all binaries are alike. Some
                  binary formats such as raster image formats might be effectively opaque, with only some metadata
                  readable; other formats such as compression formats are simply wrappers for other resources.</p>
               <p>One important member of this category is a file representing a zipped or compressed file set, as
                  defined for the three steps <code>p:archive</code>, <code>p:archive-manifest</code>, and
                     <code>p:unarchive</code>.</p>
               <p><code>content-type="*/*</code> is a match for <q>any content type</q>, very useful for handling
                  arbitrary inputs, to the extent the processor supports them (for example moving and copying even if
                  not reading).</p>

         </section>
         <section>
            <h3>XProc and its documents</h3>
            <p>The term <q>document</q> also has <a href="https://spec.xproc.org/lastcall-2024-08/head/xproc/#documents"
                  >a definition in the XProc Specification</a>. An XProc document is both more than, and different from
               an XDM document, although as an XDM value, an XDM document object – indeed, a document object derived
               from an XML file or intended to be saved as one -- is a natural and normal thing to have as your XProc
               document. Thus: any XDM document can be an XProc document, and any XDM <em>value</em> – this includes
               documents, but also elements, element trees and even atomic values such as (most commonly) strings, can
               be treated as (one might think <q>attached to</q>) a document in XProc.</p>
            <p>If this is confusing, consider how the XProc Specification phrases it: <q>XProc 3.0 has been designed to
                  make it possible to process any kind of document. Each document has a representation in the [<a
                     href="https://spec.xproc.org/lastcall-2024-08/head/xproc/#xpath-datamodel">XQuery and XPath Data
                     Model 3.1</a>].</q> In this context, however, the word <q>document</q> is very broad and
               open-ended, implicitly leaving room for (while stepping aside from) the fact that many documents of
               interest are in relatively opaque formats such as PDF, Office Open format (often suffixed
                  <code>docx</code>), or varieties of plain text including Markdown. In order to enable processors to
               support them, such data sets have to be considered as potential inputs to XProc – along with JSON and
               indeed other formats both unspecified and underspecified.</p>
            <p>XProc does this as usual by defining how to approach the common easy cases and leaving the uncommon or
               more difficult cases in an open category for developers to experiment. The common easy cases are also the
               vast majority of cases: XML and its cousin HTML; plain text; and now also JSON as a standard
               serialization for data structured as objects or what XDM calls <em>maps</em>.</p>
         </section>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>File formats and XProc content type</h2>
         <p>These common cases are defined by mappings between XDM object types, and content-type properties (on XProc
            documents) as follows:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>An XDM element tree is treated as content type <code>application/xml</code>. Note that such an element
               tree might have more than one element, thus breaking one of the rules of XML documents (as character
               streams), namely that only a single element is found at the root. It does however correspond to the XDM
                  <code>document-node()</code> object, which constitutes a tree of elements and attributes without
               imposing the single-root-element rule.</li>
            <li>A content type <code>application/json</code> can accommodate data appearing as XDM maps or array objects
               – or conversely, JSON data acquired by the system can be supported directly in XDM by casting into the
               appropriate XDM equivalent to JSON object types, namely <code>map</code> (for JSON objects),
                  <code>array</code> (for arrays), <code>xs:double</code> (for numbers), <code>xs:string</code> (for
               strings), <code>xs:boolean</code>, etc. This makes JSON accessible to XPath from within XProc.</li>
            <li>A content type <code>text</code> or <code>text/plain</code> (or <code>text/*</code>) is available for
               text-based formats that qualify as neither XML nor HTML </li>
            <li>Content type <code>application/html</code> is available to support special handling of HTML, which
               requires its own parsing and serialization logic distinct from XML's. In other respects HTML is treated
               internally just like XML, with the added advantage of being recognized as HTML within the XProc.</li>
            <li>Other content types can be supported by processors as optional features, for example by a
                  <code>p:unarchive</code> step (which reads a compressed file and delivers its contents): the list is
               open-ended (discussed further below).</li>
         </ul>
         <p>XProc inherits this concept from Internet standards such as RFC 2045 (1996) and subsequent specifications
            for file and attachment types on the Internet. Naturally, since a file's nominal format is scoped to its
            extent (while we have nominally multi-part formats such as <code>multipart/x-zip</code>, each media type
            descriptor is assigned to a file, giving us a single media type per file), this becomes the most useful and
            transparent way to manage file format distinctions. Names may <i>mostly</i> indicate file types, as we
            conventionally suffix both XML and JSON (<code>xml</code> and <code>json</code> respectively), as this rule
            is inevitably useful even when not a practical requirement. At the same time the name cannot be everything,
            or at some point anything (names can be wrong), so when the system reports a file as
               <code>application/xml</code> we should be inclined to believe it, unless and until we have better
            information to the contrary.</p>
         <p>Because an XProc processor comes ready to recognize a range of content types, this becomes an indispensable
            point of control for managing our information across the variety of formats in which we find it. XML is a
            meta-language, and describes a syntax while not prescribing any semantics beyond the structural semantics
            implied in element and attribute naming and containment – this proves to be a very useful in the XProc
            context, since it means that semantics can be abstracted out – the further the better – into externalized
            transformations and processes (often, XSLTs) that become black boxes and resources to manage, rather than
            more code in the code base. But the world deals in much more than XML, and XProc makes the same layering and
            separation of concerns possible with JSON and other standardized or codified serialization formats.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Content type 'application/json'</h2>
         <p>XProc follows the lead of XPath in offering two distinct but complementary ways of handling JSON.</p>
         <section>
            <h3>JSON as XPath <code>map</code> object</h3>
            <p>With XPath 3.1 the language now supports arrays and maps as first-class objects. These are an important
               addition to XPath, among other reasons because JSON object types now all have natural equivalents within
               XDM: strings, numeric types, Boolean values, and now arrays and maps can be represented and processed
               natively in XPath. These objects are supported in XPath with operations appropriate to them - such that,
               for example, <code>$map('field')</code> or more succinctly <code>$map?field</code> will return the value
               of the <code>field</code> field on the object defined as <code>$map</code>. Since map keys do not
               duplicate, they essentially correspond exactly with JSON objects.</p>
            <p>XPath maps are <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/#id-maps">described in full in the XPath
                  specification</a>. Given JSON as a string, acquire a map object (or array object, if appropriate) by
               providing it to the XPath function <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/#func-parse-json"
                     ><code>parse-json()</code></a>, or alternatively, read a JSON file using the <a
                  href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/#func-json-doc"><code>json-doc()</code></a>. The
               pipeline <a href="../../worksheets/READ-JSON-TESTING.xpl">READ-JSON-TESTING.xpl</a>
               provides an experimental surface for working this functionality.</p>
            <p>Since XProc supports a JSON content type, handling document objects holding singleton JSON objects
               (whether these be objects, arrays, or values in JSON) is natural and easy to do.</p>
            <p>Much more natural than using an XPath function to acquire a map object, XProc will simply read a JSON
               file for you, using the same <code>p:document</code> or <code>p:load</code> as used everywhere else. The
               processor is able to do the right thing in this case as well, namely read the file input and cast the
               data into an XDM map structure.</p>
            <p>A pipeline with a simple binding to a JSON file, using <code>p:load</code> or <code>p:document</code>, is
               enough to demonstrate this.</p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h3>Your JSON, as XML</h3>
            <p>Let's say you know you can have a map object, but you'd much prefer good-old XML. Map objects have the
               advantage of efficiency but some disadvantages for transparency. They are great for querying, but not
               necessarily as easy as node trees to see, write in and out (as XML), transform and debug.</p>
            <p>And indeed while you might like an XML version of your data object, so might also XProc need to be able
               to cast JSON into XML at any time, for example as part of a <code>p:cast-content-type</code> step.</p>
            <p>Because the JSON object structure reduces into a few rudiments, an XML representation of any JSON input
               is straightforward to produce, as long as names in XML are suitably generic as to type (like
                  <code>number</code> and <code>string</code>, for example), and correspond to types known in JSON. A
               vocabulary for doing so is also well defined, quite concise and even reasonably efficient (for processing
               if not storage). <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/#json-to-xml-mapping"> This
                  vocabulary</a> is defined in XPath 3.0.</p>
            <p>This XML is easy to see: all it requires is the XProc <code>p:cast-content-type</code> step with
                  <code>content-type="application/xml"</code>, applied to your map object (JSON) input.</p>
            <p>If your system already has such XML, you can cast it back to JSON (map or array) using the same step,
               with <code>content-type="application/json"</code>.</p>
            <p>Again, this casting emulates what is also possible in XPath natively, using the
                  <code>json-to-xml()</code> function.</p>
         </section>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Other content types</h2>
         <p>Important content types besides XML and JSON include <code>plain/text</code> for plain text and two types
            for HTML: <code>text/html</code> (for less rigorous flavors of HTML) and
            <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>.</p>
         <p>Additionally, XProc processors can support other content types as processor options, such as zip-file
            content types for compressed files or packages.</p>
         <p>Managing content types is most important on the input side, because they provide XProc with information it
            needs to parse the data reliably. They are also useful to specify on outputs. Making them explicit on either
            input or output ports is a good practice for both documentation and error detection. The XProc Specification
            gives some information about <a href="https://spec.xproc.org/master/head/xproc/#specified-content-types">how
               content type settings can be abbreviated</a> in some circumstances.</p>
         <p>In XProc it is useful to distinguish between content types and serializations – inasmuch as it is only the
            latter being, for example, that constitute something like strings of text. Content types, in contrast, are
            more like species of data object, albeit within or accommodated to XDM, as for example HTML content types
            must be. On the serialization side: XSLT or XQuery users familiar with the output methods <code>text</code>,
               <code>xml</code> and <code>html</code> should be able to make these work; and serialization settings when
            XProc writes out its content types to files are indeed guided by <a
               href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-xquery-serialization-31/">applicable standards</a></p>
