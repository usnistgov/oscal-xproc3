      <h1>101: Unpacking XProc 3.0</h1>
      <section>
         <h2>Goals</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>More familiarity with XProc 3.0, including some syntax</li>
            <li>Some awareness of XProc's capabilities, along with context including background history, concepts and
               resources</li>
         </ul>
         <p>If you read only a single page from this tutorial, and you know nothing about XProc, this page could offer
            the most rapid introduction.</p>
         <p>But a further goal is to stimulate a reader's curiosity along with their awareness.</p>

         <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
         <p><b>No prerequisites.</b> The commentary assumes, however:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>You have run the acquisition, setup and test pipelines <a href="../acquire/acquire_101_src.html"
                  class="LessonUnit">described in the first lesson set</a>, or you are willing to pretend you have done
               so for our purposes here</li>
            <li><i>Either</i>, you have some prior experience with XML technologies, web publishing technologies, data
               modeling and Internet-based data interchange</li>
            <li><i>Or</i> (again) you are open to learning or at least thinking about it</li>
         </ul>
         <p>If you fall into neither of these categories – welcome, and congratulations on your perseverence at least.
            These pages are certainly available to be read and referenced even if you are not running any of the
            software: as part of the resource provided (the repository as a whole), they are open to anyone who finds
            them to be useful, including for specialized purposes.</p>

         <h2>Resources</h2>
         <p>This lesson discusses, in more depth, the same pipelines you ran in setup: <a
               href="../acquire/acquire_101_src.html" class="LessonUnit">Setup 101</a>, in particular <a
               href="../../../smoketest/readme.md">the smoke test pipelines</a>.</p>
         <p>Also, this lesson discusses a pipeline used for producing this tutorial: <a
               href="../../PRODUCE-PROJECTS-ELEMENTLIST.xpl">PRODUCE-PROJECTS-ELEMENTLIST.xpl</a> generates an <a
               href="../../sequence/element-directory.md">index to XProc in this repository</a>. It is offered as a
            first demonstration (among other things) of XProc applied to XProc.</p>

         <h2>A closer look</h2>
         <p>If you have completed <a href="../acquire/acquire_101_src.html" class="LessonUnit">Acquire 102</a> you have
            already inspected the <a href="../../../lib/readme.md">lib</a> and <a href="../../../smoketest/readme.md"
               >smoketest</a> folders, and run the pipelines you have found there. If you haven't, now is a moment to
            catch up. Even if you have decided not to install any software, please look at the pipelines we are using
            for the purpose here.</p>
         <p>Routine code inspection can also be done <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-xproc3">on Github</a>
            as well (not a bad idea in any case), not just in a copy of the distribution. If you are reading this in the
            repository, the pipelines files (generally, suffixed <code>xpl</code> by convention) can be inspected in
            another browser window.</p>
         <p>A quick summary of what these pipelines do:</p>
         <ul>
            <li><a href="../../../lib/GRAB-SAXON.xpl">lib/GRAB-SAXON.xpl</a> downloads a zip file from a <a
                  href="https://www.saxonica.com/download">Saxonica download site</a>, saves it, and extracts a
                  <code>jar</code> (Java library) file, which it places in the Morgana library directory</li>
            <li><a href="../../../lib/GRAB-SCHXSLT.xpl">lib/GRAB-SCHXSLT.xpl</a> downloads a zip file from Github and
               unzips it into a directory where Morgana can find it.</li>
            <li><a href="../../../lib/GRAB-XSPEC.xpl">lib/GRAB-XSPEC.xpl</a> also downloads and <q>unarchives</q> a zip
               file resource, this time a copy of <a href="https://github.com/xspec/xspec">an XSpec
               distribution</a>.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Essentially, these all replicate and capture the work a developer must do to identify and acquire libraries.
            Maintaining our dependencies this way – not quite, but almost <q>by hand</q> – appears to have benefits for
            system transparency and robustness.</p>
         <p>The second group of pipelines is a bit more interesting. Each of the utilities provided for in packages just
            downloaded is tested by running a <b>smoke test</b>.</p>
         <p>Each smoke test performs a minor task, with the aim of determining whether a simple representative process
            will complete successfully. (When we plug the unit in and switch on the power, can we see and smell smoke?
            Do tracebacks burn your retinas?)</p>
         <ul>
            <li><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XPROC3.xpl">smoketest/TEST-XPROC3.xpl</a> amounts to an XProc <q>Hello
                  World</q>. In that spirit, feel free to write your own version. (You get another chance to do this <a
                  href="walkthrough_102_src.html" class="LessonUnit">real soon now</a>.)</li>
            <li><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XSLT.xpl">smoketest/TEST-XSLT.xpl</a> tests Saxon, an XSLT/XQuery
               transformation engine. XSLT and XQuery are related technologies (different languages, same data model)
               developed with XML processing in mind, but in recent years generalized to a wider range of data
               structures.</li>
            <li><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-SCHEMATRON.xpl">smoketest/TEST-SCHEMATRON.xpl</a> tests SchXSLT.
               SchXSLT is an implementation of Schematron, an ISO-standard validation and reporting technology. As this
               implementation relies on XSLT, this library also requires Saxon.</li>
            <li><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XSPEC.xpl">smoketest/TEST-XSPEC.xpl</a> tests XSpec, an XSLT-based
               testing framework useful for testing deployments of XSLT, XQuery and Schematron.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Any and each of these can be used as a <q>black box</q> by any competent operator, even without
            understanding the internals. But this simplicity masks and manages complexity. XProc is XProc but never just
            that, since its capabilities are also extended by XSLT, XQuery, Schematron, XSpec and others, an open-ended
            set of compatible and complimentary technologies that are even more powerful together than they are in
            particular.</p>
         <p>At the same time, common foundations make it possible to learn these technologies together and in
            tandem.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Survey</h2>
         <p>Each of the test pipelines exercises a simple sequence of operations. Open any XProc file in an editor or
            viewer where you can see the tags. Skim this section to get only a high-level view.</p>
         <p>The aim here is demystification. Understand the parts to understand the whole. Reading the element names
            also inscribes them in (metaphorical) memory circuits where they will resonate later.</p>

            <h3><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XPROC3.xpl">TEST-XPROC3</a></h3>
            <p>Examine the pipeline <a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XPROC3.xpl">TEST-XPROC3.xpl</a>. It is a short
               chain of two steps, with one output offered. It breaks down as follows:</p>
            <ul>
               <li><code>p:output</code> – An <em>output port</em> is defined. It specifies that when the process
                  results are delivered, a couple of serialization rules are followed: the text is indented and written
                  without an XML declaration at the top. With this port, the process outputs can be captured by the
                  calling process (such as your script), or simply echoed to the console.</li>
               <li><code>p:identity</code> – An <em>identity step</em> does nothing with its input except pass it along.
                  This one has its input given as a literal (XML) fragment in the pipeline. Essentially, because this
                  pipeline has this step, it does not need to load or rely on any inputs, because its inputs are given
                  here. The input is a single line of XML.</li>
               <li><code>p:namespace-delete</code> – A <em>namespace-delete</em> step is used to strip an XML namespace
                  definition from the document coming back (resulting from) the prior identity step. When nothing else
                  is specifically designated as such, the input of any step is assumed to be the last step's results. In
                  this case, our XML inherits namespaces from the pipeline itself (where it is embedded), but it has no
                  elements or attributes that use it, so the namespace is unneeded and its declaration comes through as
                  noise. With this step the pipeline results are clean and simple.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you run this pipeline, the <code>CONGRATULATIONS</code> document given in line will be echoed to the
               console, where designated outputs will appear if not otherwise directed.</p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h3><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XSLT.xpl">TEST-XSLT</a></h3>
            <p><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XSLT.xpl">This pipeline</a> executes a simple XSLT transformation, in
               order to test that XSLT transformations can be successfully executed.</p>
            <ul>
               <li><code>p:output</code> – An output port is designated with <code>p:output</code> as in the <a
                     href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XPROC3.xpl">TEST-XPROC3 pipeline</a>.</li>
               <li><code>p:xslt</code> – Instead of providing a literal document in an <em>identity</em> step, this
                  pipeline performs an XSLT transformation. The input to this transformation is given as a literal XML
                  in the same way, except this time it is provided as input to a transformation process defined by an <a
                     href="../../../smoketest/src/congratulations.xsl">XSLT stylesheet</a> called in by the
                  pipeline.</li>
               <li><code>p:namespace-delete</code> – The <code>ox</code> namespace is stripped from the result as in <a
                     href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XPROC3.xpl">TEST-XPROC3 pipeline</a>. This could have been done in
                  the XSLT as well, but this way the transformation has one less thing to do or go wrong. More simpler
                  steps prove more legible and tractable than fewer complicated ones.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Like the <a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XPROC3.xpl">TEST-XPROC3 pipeline</a> this pipeline shows its
               results in the console. This time the result is not just the XML given in the pipeline, but that XML as
               modified by the transformation.</p>
            <p>If your pipeline execution can't process the XSLT (perhaps Saxon is not installed, or the XSLT itself has
               a problem) you will get an error saying so.</p>
            <p>Errors in XProc are reported by the XProc engine, typically using XML syntax. (The exact format of errors
               depends on the processor, and they are very much worth comparing.) Among other things, this means that
               XML results (for example showing errors trapped in try/catch) can be captured and processed in
               pipelines.</p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h3><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-SCHEMATRON.xpl">TEST-SCHEMATRON</a></h3>
            <p>Schematron is a language used to specify rules to apply to XML documents. In this case a small Schematron
               is applied to a small XML. This flexible technology enables easy testing of XML against rule sets defined
               either for particular cases in particular workflows, or for entire classes or sets of documents whose
               rules are defined for standards and across systems.</p>
            <ul>
               <li><code>p:output</code> – An output port is designated for the results with the same settings.</li>
               <li><code>p:validate-with-schematron</code> – This is an XProc step specifically for evaluating an XML
                  document against the rules of a given Schematron. Like the TEST-XPROC3 and TEST-XSLT` pipelines, this
                  one presents its own input, given as a literal XML document given in the pipeline document (using
                     <code>p:inline</code>). A setting on this step provides for it to throw an error if the document
                  does not conform to the rules. The Schematron file provided as input to this step, <a
                     href="../../../smoketest/src/doing-well.sch">src/doing-well.sch</a>, gives the rules.</li>
               <li><code>p:namespace-delete</code> – This step is used here as in the other tests for final cleanup of
                  the information set produced (as a namespace-qualified XML document).</li>
            </ul>

         <section>
            <h3><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XSPEC.xpl">TEST-XSPEC</a></h3>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/xspec/xspec">XSpec</a> is a testing framework for XSLT, XQuery and
               Schematron. It takes the form of a vocabulary and a process (inevitably implemented in XSLT and XQuery)
               for executing queries, transformations, and validations, by running them over known inputs, comparing the
               results to expected results, and reporting the results of this comparison. XProc, built to orchestrate
               manipulations of XML contents, is well suited for running XSpec.</p>
            <p>An XSpec instance (as a document in itself) defines a set of tests for a transformation or query module
               using the XSpec vocabulary. An XSpec implementation executes the tests and delivers the results. Since
               XSpec, like Schematron, reports its findings in XML, XProc can be useful both to manage the inputs and
               outputs, and to process the XSpec reports.</p>
            <ul>
               <li><code>p:import</code> – calls to an external XProc file to make its step definitions available.</li>
               <li><code>p:input</code> – works as it does elsewhere, to declare inputs for the pipeline. In this case,
                  the inputs must be XSpec documents using the XSpec vocabulary. You can expect errors when they are
                  not. This testing pipeline offers three different XSpecs to be run, one each for XSLT, XQuery and
                  Schematron.</li>
               <li><code>p:for-each</code> – defines a step or sequence of steps to be applied to each input,
                  separately.</li>
               <li><code>p:identity</code> – simply passes through the previous step's result. While this is a
                     <q>no-op</q> in the XProc itself, it provides an occasion for a message to help trace the XProc
                  execution.</li>
            </ul>

         <h2>A not-so-simple pipeline</h2>
         <p>Examine the Markdown file presenting an <a href="../../sequence/element-directory.md">XProc Element
               directory</a>. It is generated by <a href="../../PRODUCE-PROJECTS-ELEMENTLIST.xpl">a pipeline</a>.
            Examine that pipeline to see XProc with real-world complexity.</p>
         <p>The simple pipelines examined so far show how useful things can be done simply, while the pipeline
            architecture allows for great flexibility.</p>
         <p>Simplicity and flexibility together enable complexity. Once it is factored out, a complex operation can be
            managed and deployed just like a simple one, with its internal complexities masked by a simple and
            predictable interface.</p>
         <p>Next, take a look at a more complex example, the prototype pipeline <a
               href="../../PRODUCE-PROJECTS-ELEMENTLIST.xpl">PRODUCE-PROJECTS-ELEMENTLIST.xpl</a>. Like the setup and
            smoke-test pipelines, this is a standalone pipeline (requiring no runtime bindings or settings): when this
            plan (<q>step</q> or pipeline) is executed, the processor acquires inputs, produces results for its
            operations, and write those results to the file system. In this case the output it generates is stored as <a
               href="../../sequence/element-directory.md">element-directory.md</a>, a Markdown file (find the
               <code>p:store</code> step).</p>
         <p>The result is a reference resource encoded in Markdown: an index of XProc elements used in pipelines in this
            repository. As Markdown, once reposted back into the repository, it can be viewed with any Markdown viewing
            application. The index lists XProc elements, i.e., the core of the XProc vocabulary: for any XProc element
            used anywhere among the projects listed, the listing shows the pipelines where it appears. Following the
            index, the resource also shows a list of (repository) project folders in a prescribed order, with their
            XProc files and whatever XProc elements appear <i>first</i> (within the entire sequence up to to point)
            within that file. Among other uses this is helpful for assessing coverage of tutorial lessons as it offers a
            (semi) <i>ordered</i> survey of their use of XProc (and other) elements.</p>
         <p>For example, looking up <code>p:store</code> you can see all the pipelines that contain this common step. Or
            looking at the <code>oscal-convert</code> listing you can see the XProc steps appearing first in that
            project folder.</p>
         <p>To confirm proper functioning, run the pipeline again after deleting or renaming the Markdown result
            file.</p>
         <p>Consider also what other kinds of indexing might be useful. When you modify XProc or add new XProc pipelines
            to the project folders, consider running this pipeline again to update the indexes.</p>
         <p>Open the file and inspect it to get a sense of how it works. The XML syntax is verbose, but not really all
            that frightening. Practice helps! The pipeline is also considered in the <a href="walkthrough_102_src.html"
               class="LessonUnit">102 Lesson unit</a> segment.</p>
         <section>
            <h3>PRODUCE-PROJECTS-ELEMENTLIST</h3>
            <p>The pipeline <a href="../../PRODUCE-PROJECTS-ELEMENTLIST.xpl">PRODUCE-PROJECTS-ELEMENTLIST.xpl</a>
               contains XML comments (<code>&lt;!-- using comment syntax --></code>) that should help explain its
               operations.</p>
            <p>There are some significant differences between this pipeline and the small ones we have looked at so
               far.</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Of course, it is longer and more complex, reflecting the complexity of the operations it
                  performs.</li>
               <li>Part of the complexity is due to a two-step process here. First, the file system is surveyed in
                  locations named in an input configuration. Then all those resources (which happen to be XML using the
                  XProc vocabulary) are indexed again, this time showing only first occurrences of elements within files
                  given in the stipulated order. Both indexes are written into the results, showing how a single survey
                  can support more than one analysis.</li>
               <li>In particular, the index to <q>first use</q> is not simple. A great deal of the complexity of
                  detailed operations has been off-loaded into XSLT transformation code, which in this pipeline can be
                  seen embedded in the XProc, indeed occupying the greater part of the XML in the file. (About two
                  thirds of the element count: you can usually recognize XSLT by the conventional <code>xsl:</code>
                  element prefix.) This pipeline also has an XSLT called from an external file (toward the end). XProc
                  can provide XSLT either way, and each has its advantages. In this case, XSLT is left in place as
                  literal embedded code, partly to show a borderline case. (It helps to use an editor or viewer with
                  code folding.)</li>
               <li>One good thing about seeing the XSLT here is you can get a good sense of what it looks like, whether
                  embedded or kept externally. XSLT is <a href="walkthrough_401_src.html" class="LessonUnit">not
                     essential to XProc</a>, but it very much expands its practical capabilities.</li>

         <h2>Respecting XML syntax, XPath and XProc</h2>
         <p>Newcomers to XML may feel they are in the deep water with XML syntax.</p>
         <p>In the context of XProc, this is actually not as hard as it looks:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>All XML files follow the same syntax rules with respect to tags, elements and attributes (names and
               syntax), namespaces, comments etc.</li>
         </ul>
         <pre>&lt;tagged attribute="value">Information goes here&lt;/tagged>
&lt;!-- comment goes here --> </pre>
         <ul>
            <li>XML vocabularies are typically qualified with <b>namespaces</b> to show, and to disambiguate, which XML
               application or language they belong to. The namespaces are indicated by name <em>prefixes</em>. So in
               this repository (and conventionally for XProc), any element prefixed <code>p:</code> is an XProc element,
               and another prefix or none indicates an extension or another vocabulary, such as may appear in XML being
               processed.</li>
         </ul>
         <pre>&lt;p:output port="result" serialization="map{'indent' : true(), 'omit-xml-declaration': true() }" /></pre>
         <ul>
            <li>Embedded in the syntax is another syntax, <em>XPath</em>. This lightweight but powerful query language
               is a formal subset of XQuery. XPath is ubiquitous in XProc, XSLT, Schematron, XSpec etc. In XProc, the
               XPath will ordinarily be given in attributes.</li>
         </ul>
         <pre>&lt;p:output port="result" serialization="<b>map{'indent' : true(), 'omit-xml-declaration': true() }</b>" /></pre>
         <ul>

         <h2>Learning more about XProc</h2>
         <p>This tutorial has a handmade <a href="../../xproc-links.md">XProc links page</a> with links.</p>
         <p>Also, see the official <a href="https://xproc.org">XProc.org dashboard page</a>.</p>
         <p>Also, check out indexing logic offered in the <a href="../../../projects/xproc-doc/readme.md">xproc-doc
               project folder</a>. It has pipelines producing useful indexes to XProc in this repository and in general,
            including one producing an <a href="../../../projects/xproc-doc/XPROC-STEP-INDEX-HTML.xpl">index to XProc
               simple steps</a> in HTML, with code snips.</p>
         <p>There is <a href="https://xmlpress.net/publications/xproc-3-0/">a book, Erik Siegel's <i>XProc 3.0
                  Programmer's Reference</i></a> (2020) and an <a href="https://xprocref.org/index.html">excellent
               reference site</a> by the same author. Like this resource, it is generated using XProc.</p>
