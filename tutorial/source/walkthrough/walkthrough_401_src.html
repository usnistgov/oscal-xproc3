         <h2>XSLT: XSL (XML Stylesheet Language) Transformations</h2>
         <p>XSLT has a long and amazing history to go with its checkered reputation. Its role in XProc is similarly
            ambiguous: in one sense it is an optional power feature: a nice-to-have. In another sense it can be regarded
            as foundational. XSLT is the reason to have XProc.</p>
         <p>Chances are good that if you are not current on the latest XSLT version, you have little idea of what we are
            talking about, as it may have changed quite a bit (and even despite external appearances) since you last saw
            it. You may think you know it but you might have to reconsider.</p>
         <p>Users who last used XSLT 1.0 and even 2.0, in particular, can consider their knowledge out of date until
            they have taken a look at XSLT 3.0.</p>
         <p>Moreover, within the context of XProc, experienced users of XSLT should also consider it may take a
            different form, as it is unburdened of some operations that better belong outside it - operations such as
            those provided by XProc itself. Within XProc, XSLT may often be simpler than out in systems where it has to
            do more work.</p>
         <p>Over time, the principle of pipelining, iterative amelioration (as it might be described) or <q>licking into
               shape</q> has been repeatedly demonstrated. Of course it proves easier to do a complicated task when
            broken into a series of simpler tasks. On Java alone, ways of deploying operations in sequence include at
            least <a href="https://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>, Apache Tomcat/<a href="https://cocoon.apache.org/"
               >Cocoon</a> (a web processing framework), XQuery (such as <a href="https://basex.org/">BaseX</a> or <a
               href="https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/homepage/index.html">eXist-db</a> engines) and XSLT (<a
               href="https://www.saxonica.com/documentation12/index.html#!functions/fn/transform">Saxon</a>) to say
            nothing of batch scripts, shell scripts and <q>transformation scenarios</q> or the like, as offered by XML
            tools and toolkits.</p>
         <p>All can be disturbingly haphazard. In contrast to the varied stopgap solutions, XProc helps quite a bit by
            taking over from XSLT, to whatever extent necessary and useful, any aspects of processing that require any
            sort of interaction with the wider system. This way XSLT plays to its strengths, while XProc standardizes
            and simplifies how it works. On one hand, XProc enables XSLT when needed, while on the other XProc may
            enable us largely to do without it, offering both a useful feature set and the flexibility we need, but with
            less overhead, especially with regard to routine chores like designating sets of inputs and outputs, or
            sequencing operations. The principle of Least Power may well apply here: it saves our present and our future
            selves effort if we can arrange and manage to do fewer things less. XProc lets us do less.</p>
         <p>With XSLT together, this effect is magnified. XSLT lets us write less XProc, and XProc lets us write less
            XSLT. Together they are easier than either would be without the other to lighten the lift.</p>
         <p>XProc lets us use XSLT when we must, but also keeps routine and simple things both simple and consistent.
            And it adapts itself well to new requirements as they become more complicated. Ultimately, it spares the
            XSLT developer the problem of having to design, build and test something like XProc.</p>
         <section>
            <h3>Reflecting on XSLT</h3>
            <p>Programmers can think of XSLT as a domain-specific language (DSL) or fourth-generation language (4GL)
               designed for the purpose of manipulating data structures suitable for documents and messages as well as
               for structured data sets. As such, XSLT is highly generalized and abstract and can be applied to a very
               broad range of problems. Its main distinguishing feature among similar languages (which tend to be
               functional languages such as Scala and Scheme) is that it is optimized for use specifically with
               XML-based data formats, offering well-defined handling of information sets expressed in XML, while the
               language itself uses XML syntax, affording nice composability, reflection and code generation
               capabilities. XSLT's processing model is both broadly applicable, and workable in a range of environments
               including client software or within encapsulated, secure software configurations and deployments.</p>
            <p>If your XSLT is strong enough, you don't need XProc, or not much. But as a functional language, XSLT is
               best used in a functionally pure, <q>stateless</q> way that does not interact with the system: no <q>side
                  effects</q>. This is related to its definitions of conformant processing (X inputs produce Y outputs)
               and the determinism, based in mathematical formalisms, that underlies its idea of conformance. However
               one cost of mathematical purity is that operations that do interact with stateful externalities – things
               such as reading and writing files – are not in XSLT's <q>comfort zone</q>. XSLT works by defining what a
               new structure A' should look like for any given structure A, using such terms as a conformant XSLT engine
               can then effectuate. But to turn an actual A into an actual A' we must first acquire A – or an effective
               surrogate thereof – and moreover make our A' available, in some form. XSLT leaves it up to its processor
               and <q>calling application</q> to handle this aspect of the problem – which they typically do by offering
               interfaces for an XSLT transformation's nominal <em>source</em> and (primary) <em>result</em>. Often,
               this gap has been bridged by extended functionality in processors. Does your processor read and parse XML
               files off the file system? Can it be connected to upstream data producers in different ways? Can it use
               HTTP <code>GET</code> and <code>PUT</code>? The answer may be Yes to any or all of these. Throughout its
               history, XSLT in later versions was also extended in this direction, with features such as the
                  <code>collection()</code> function, <code>xsl:result-document</code>, <code>doc-available()</code> and
               other features we may not need if we are using XProc.</p>

            <h3>Running XSLT without XProc</h3>
            <p>As a standard and an externally-specified technology, XSLT can in principle be implemented on any
               platform, but the leading XSLT implementation for some years has been Saxon, produced by Saxonica of
               Reading, England. Saxon has achieved market share and developer support on a record of
               strictly-conformant, performant applications, deployed as an open-source software product free for
               developers to use and integrate. (While doing this, Saxonica also has related product offerings including
               optimized processor for those who choose to support it.)</p>
            <p>Download and run Saxon to apply XSLT to XML and other inputs, without XProc.</p>

      <section>
         <h2>Using XSLT in XProc: avoiding annoyances</h2>
         <p>If you are an experienced XSLT user, congratulations! The power XProc puts into your hands is everything you
            might think and hope.</p>
         <p>There are a couple of small but potentially annoying considerations when embedding XSLT literals in your
            XProc code. They do not apply when your XSLT is called from out of line, acquired by binding to an input
            port or even <code>p:load</code>. If you acquire and even manipulate your XSLT without including literal
            XSLT code in your XProc, that eliminates the syntax-level clashes at the roots of both these problems.</p>
         <section>
            <h3>Text and attribute value syntax in embedded XSLT</h3>
            <p>XSLT practitioners know that within XSLT, in attributes and (in XSLT 3.0) within text (as directed), the
               curly brace signs <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> have special semantics as <a
                  href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/#attribute-value-templates">attribute</a> or <a
                  href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/#text-value-templates">text value templates</a>. In the latter
               case, the operation can be controlled with an <code>xsl:expand-text</code> setting. When effective as
               template delimiters, these characters can be escaped and hidden from processing by doubling them:
                  <code>{{</code> for <code>{</code> etc.</p>
            <p>XProc offers a similar feature for expanding expressions dynamically, indicated with a
                  <code>p:expand-text</code> setting much like XSLT's.</p>
            <p>Because they both operate, an XSLT author must take care to provide for the correct escaping (sometimes
               more than one level) or settings on either language's <code>expand-text</code> option. Searching the
               repository for the string value <code>{{</code> (two open curlies together) will turn up instances of
               this – or try <a href="../../worksheets/NAMESPACE_worksheet.xpl">a worksheet XProc with XSLT
               embedded</a>.</p>

            <h3>Namespaces in and for your XSLT</h3>
            <p><a href="../oscal-convert/oscal-convert_350_src.html" class="LessonUnit">A lesson unit on namespaces in
                  XProc</a> may help newcomers or anyone mystified by XML namespaces. They are worth mentioning here
               because everything tricky in XProc regarding namespaces is doubly tricky with XSLT in the picture.</p>
            <p>In brief: keep in mind XSLT has its own features for both configuring namespace-based matching on
               elements by name (such as <code>xpath-default-namespace</code>), and for managing namespaces in
               serialization (<code>exclude-namespace-prefixes</code>). In the XProc context, however, your XSLT will
               typically not be writing results directly, instead only producing the same kind of (XDM) tree as is
               emitted and consumed by other steps.</p>

         <h2>Learning XSLT the safer way</h2>
         <p>If setting out to learn XSLT, pause to read the following <i>short</i> list of things to which you should
            give early attention, in order:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Namespaces in XML and XSLT: names, name prefixes, unprefixed names and the
                  <code>xpath-default-namespace</code> setting (not available until XSLT 2.0)</li>
            <li>Templates and modes in XSLT: template matching, <code>xsl:apply-templates</code>, built-in templates,
               and using modes to configure default behaviors when no template matches</li>
            <li>XPath, especially absolute and relative location paths: start easy and work up</li>
         </ol>
         <p>Understanding each of these will provide useful insights into XProc.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>XProc without XSLT?</h2>
         <p>XProc does not require XSLT absolutely, even if XSLT is indispensable for some XProc libraries, including
            those in this repository.</p>
         <p>How could we do without it?</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Using XQuery any time queries get complicated</li>
            <li>Use XProc where possible, for example steps that support matches on patterns? E.g.
               <code>p:insert</code>, <code>p:label-elements</code> and <code>p:add-attribute</code></li>
            <li>Reliance on iterators and <code>p:viewport</code></li>
            <li>Much smarter (declarative, data-centric) HTML or other dialect in the application space?</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Chances are, there is a limit. One thing XSLT does better than almost any comparable technology is support
            generalized or granular mappings between vocabularies.</p>
         <p>So not only creating, but also consuming HTML, is the place we begin with XSLT. But since it is also very
            fine for other vocabulary mappings in the middle and back, it becomes indispensable almost as soon as it is
            available for use.</p>
         <p>An XSLT that is used repeatedly can of course always be encapsulated as an XProc step.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>XProc, XDM (the XML data model) and the standards stack</h2>
         <p>Another critical consideration is whether and to what extent XProc and XSLT introduce unwanted dependencies,
            which make them strategically not a good choice (or not a good choice for everyone) at least in comparison
            to alternatives. These are standards in every way including nominally, emerging as the work of organizations
            such as W3C and ISO, while not escaping a reputation as <q>boutique</q> or <q>niche</q> technologies. Yet
            alternative models – whether offered by large software vendors and service providers, or by forests of
            Javascript libraries, or a bespoke stack using a developers' favorite flavor of Markdown or microformats –
            have not all fared very well either. Often scorned, XSLT has a reputation for projects migrating away from
            it as much as towards it. Yet look closely, and when problems arise, XSLT is never the issue by itself. (A
            project choosing not to use XSLT because of a lack of understanding or skills is something differet.) Often
            the question is, were you even using the right tool? It helps when your application is within the sweet spot
            of document processing at scale (and there is a sweet spot), but even this is not an absolute rule.
            Sometimes the question is, are you actually fitting the capabilities of the processing model to the problem
            at hand. Too often, that fit happens by accident. Too often, other considerations prevail and compromises
            are made - then the resulting system is blamed.</p>
         <p>So where has XML-based processing been not only tenable but rewarding over the long term? Interestingly, its
            success is to be found often in projects that have survived across more than one system over time, that have
            grown from one system into another, and that have morphed and adapted and grown new limbs. In many cases,
            look at them today and you do not see the same system as you would have only five years ago.</p>
