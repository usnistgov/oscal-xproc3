         <h2>Details details!</h2>
         <p>XProc pipelines described in <a href="walkthrough_101_src.html" class="LessonUnit">the previous lesson unit</a>
            contain a few noteworthy features.</p>
         <p> To edit these files, use any XML-capable plain text editor (that is, with care, any editor at all that
            saves text files as UTF-8).</p>
         <section>
            <h3>TEST-XSPEC</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>Where XSpec documents are bound to the input port <code>source</code>, they have
                     <code>content-type='application/xml'</code> given. This is because with the unconventional file
                  suffix <code>xspec</code> (useful for other reasons), the XProc engine needs extra information to know
                  they should be read as XML, not some other data format. Try removing the <code>content-type</code> to
                  see what happens when the engine does not know an XML file is XML.</li>
               <li>The step <code>p:for-each</code> is not just a step: it also contains steps. It is a <em>compound
                     step</em>. You would be correct to infer this step enables us to perform operations on several
                  inputs in parallel: just what this pipeline needs.</li>
               <li>Within the <code>p:for-each</code>, the step <code>ox:execute-xspec</code> is named in the
                     <code>ox</code> namespace, which resolves to the string
                     <code>http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal-xproc3</code>, a value assigned for this project. This step is
                  defined in the <a href="../../../xspec/xspec-execute.xpl">imported pipeline</a>. XProc is indefinitely
                  extensible: the namespace feature allows us to create new steps without fear of name clashes with old
                  steps – or steps that are still uninvented and unnamed. We can develop and name steps in our own
                  namespace, while also acquiring and using steps in other namespaces.</li>
               <li>The <code>p:identity</code> step is used twice in this pipeline for one purpose only: to indicate
                  messages the XProc engine should deliver. In the normal configuration, you should see these messages
                  in the console when the pipeline runs. This is a common use for <code>p:identity</code>.</li>
               <li>The repository observes a couple of conventions with regard to steps and messages. For example: any
                     <code>p:load</code> or <code>p:save</code> step should have a message; and messages should always
                  be prefixed with a bracketed indicator of the pipeline that issues them, for example the
                     <code>[TEST-XSPEC]</code> messages that are emitted here, once for each input and again once when
                  the pipeline finishes.</li>
               <li>Yes, those conventions are enforced in the repository by <a
                     href="../../../testing/xproc3-house-rules.sch">a Schematron</a> that can be applied to any
                  pipeline, both in development and when it is committed to the repository under CI/CD (continuous
                  integration / continous development). Assuming we take care to run our tests and validations, this
                  does most of the difficult work maintaining consistency, namely detecting the inconsistency.</li>
               <li>Reassuring messages aside, no XSpec reports are actually captured by this XProc! With nothing bound
                  to an output port, it <em>sinks</em> by default. That is because it is a smoke test, and we care only
                  to see that it runs and completes without error. The inputs are all controlled, so we know what those
                  reports say. Or we can find out.</li>
            </ul>
         </section>

            <h3>PRODUCE-PROJECTS-ELEMENTLIST</h3>
            <p>The pipeline <a href="../../PRODUCE-PROJECTS-ELEMENTLIST.xpl">PRODUCE-PROJECTS-ELEMENTLIST.xpl</a> has
                  <q>real-world complexity</q>. Reviewing its steps can give a sense of how XProc combines simple
               capabilities into complex operations. Notwithstanding the title of this section, it is not important to
               understand every detail – knowing they are there is enough.</p>
            <ul>
               <li>The prologue here contains a single <code>p:input</code> configuration. This one gives the input in
                  line, as an XML document. Within this XML, all the project folders to be covered by the index are
                  listed. Their order also matters since one of the two indexes built works incrementally, prior
                  elements affecting what happens with later elements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This pipeline exploits one other important feature of XProc: so far at least, it is all XML. Even short
               of of dynamically generating and executing XProc (a feature the language  <a
                  href="https://spec.xproc.org/lastcall-2024-08/head/run/">provides for</a>), the common ground of XML
               format means that with XProc working XML tools, XML and its related ecosystem (most significantly but not
               only XPath) is always available as an instrumental force magnifier or power tool, something we can put to
               work again and again. In XProc, errors are reported in XML. So we can capture, aggregate and index error
               messages in XProc. In XProc, a directory file listing is provided in XML. So we have a ready way to
               present views of file systems – the XML shows all the names and structures – as well as analyze them and
               access the files in them. Etc.</p>

         <h2>Messing around</h2>
         <p>Taking some time to make and test small adjustments to working code is a great way to develop a sense of how
            it behaves.</p>
         <p>An easy way to do this without perturbing the working code in the repository is to copy a pipeline and
            modify the copy. Modifying any of the pipelines presented so far, see what happens when:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>An <code>@href</code> points to a location on the system where there is no file</li>
            <li>A file is there, but it is not what is expected (for example: XML is expected but the file is not well
               formed)</li>
            <li>A <code>p:namespace-delete</code> step is removed from the end of a pipeline – how does the result
               change?</li>
            <li>Other steps are excluded</li>
            <li>New elements are renamed (etc.)</li>
         </ul>
         <p>When changes introduce errors, runtime failures and tracebacks will <i>sometimes</i> appear. The indicated
            problem or the source of the reported problem must be repaired.</p>
         <p>And sometimes a process will run successfully, despite an <q>error</q>. Whether it is in error then depends
            on how well it conforms to its requirements. Does it deliver the results we want and expect?</p>
         <p>As an exercise, make some changes in copies of the test pipelines. Make at least one change that produces
            outputs (such as echoing a document to the console) that are visibly different from the results of the
            original pipeline.</p>
         <section>
            <h3>Disabling your code</h3>
            <p>For newcomers to XML coding – you can <q>comment out</q> code in any XML by wrapping it in comment
               syntax:</p>
            <pre>&lt;tagged>Text&lt;/tagged></pre>
            <p>becomes:</p>
            <pre>&lt;!--  &lt;tagged>Text&lt;/tagged> --></pre>
            <p>A code editor that supports XML might let you do this with a keystroke, for example <code>ctrl-,</code>
               (Control key plus comma), after selecting the text you wish to include in the comment.</p>
            <p>Take care when doing this that the XML is still intact with all the tags balanced. This is a very useful
               technique for rapidly and interactively testing your pipelines, by deactivating and reactivating blocks
               of code.</p>

         <h2>Take note</h2>
         <section>
            <h3>Where are these downloads coming from?</h3>
            <p>Pipelines can use a few different strategies for resource acquisition, depending on the case, and on
               where and in what form the resource is available. (Sometimes a file on Github is easiest to download
               "raw", sometimes an archive is downloaded and opened, and so on.) For now, it is not necessary to
               understand details in every case, only to observe the variation and range. (With more ideas welcome.
               Could XProc be used to build a <q>secure downloader</q> that knows how, for example, to compare
               hashes?)</p>
            <p>Wherever you see <code>href</code> attributes, take note.</p>
            <p>Since <code>href</code> is how XProc <q>sees</q> the world, either to read data in or to write data out,
               this attribute is a reliable indicator of an assumed feature, often a dependency of some kind. For
               example, a download will not succeed if the resource indicated by the <code>href</code> for the download
               returns an error, or nothing. In XProc, <code>href</code> attribute settings are the <i>points of
                  control</i> for interaction between an XProc pipeline, and its runtime environment.</p>
            <p>Useful detail: where XProc has <code>p:store href="some-uri.file"</code>, the <code>href</code> is read
               by the processor as the intended location for storage of pipeline data, that is, for a <i>write</i>
               operation. In other cases <code>href</code> is always an argument for a <i>read</i> operation.</p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h3>Syntax tips</h3>
            <p>In XPath syntax, <code>$foo</code> (a name with a <code>$</code> prefixed) indicates a <b>variable
                  reference</b> named (in this case) <q>foo</q>. XProc also uses a <i>value expansion syntax</i>
                  (either<i>text value syntax</i> or <i>attribute value syntax</i>) using curly braces - so syntax such
               as <code>href="{$some-xml-uri}"</code> is not uncommon. Depending on use, this would mean <q>read [or
                  write] to the URI given by <code>$some-xml-uri</code></q>.</p>
            <p>An XProc developer always knows where <code>href</code> is used in a pipeline, and how to test for and
               update its use. As always with syntax, the easiest way to learn it is to try making changes and observing
               outcomes.</p>
