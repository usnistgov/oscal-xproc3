      <h1>101: Project setup and installation</h1>
      <section>
         <h2>Goals</h2>
         <p>Set up and run an XProc 3.0 pipeline in an XProc 3.0 engine.</p>
         <p>Get some results. See them in the console (message tracebacks), the file system (new files acquired or
            produced), or both.</p>
         <p>With a little practice, become comfortable running XProc pipelines.</p>
         <p>After the first script to get the XProc engine, we use XProc for subsequent downloads. Finishing the setup
            gets you started practicing with the pipelines.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
         <p>If you have not done so, scan the <a href="../../readme.md">tutorial readme file</a> for some helpful
            background and ideas on how tutorial materials are arranged.</p>
         <p>If ready to proceed, <b>you have a system with Java installed</b> offering a JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
            available on the command line (a JRE or JDK), version 8 (and later).</p>
         <p><b>Tip:</b> check your Java version from the console using <code>java --version</code>.</p>
         <p>Also, <b>you have an Internet connection available</b> and the capability to download and save resources
            (binaries and code libraries) for local use. (There are no runtime dependencies on connecting, but some
            XProc pipelines make requests over <code>http/s</code>.)</p>
         <p><b>You are comfortable entering commands on the command line</b> (i.e. terminal or console window). For
            installation, you want a <code>bash</code> shell if available. On Windows, both WSL (Ubuntu) and Git Bash
            have been found to work. If you cannot use <code>bash</code>, the setup can be done by hand (downloading and
            unpacking a package from SourceForge).</p>
         <p>After installation, subsequent work on Windows does not require <code>bash</code> unless you choose to use
            it – a Windows <code>CMD</code> or Powershell can serve as your environment and the processor invoked with a
            Windows <code>bat</code> file (as described in the documentation). Mac and Linux (and WSL) users can
            continue to use <code>bash</code>.</p>
         <p>If you have already performed the setup as described in <a href="../../../README.md">README</a> and <a
               href="../../../setup-notes.md">setup notes</a>, this lesson unit will be a breeze.</p>
         <p>Prior knowledge of XProc, XSLT or XML is <i>not</i> a prerequisite (for this or any lesson unit). If you are
            learning as we go – at any level – welcome and please seek us out for help and feedback.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Resources</h2>
         <p>The setup script is a <code>bash</code> script: <a href="../../../setup.sh">./setup.sh</a>, to be run with
            no arguments. See <a href="../../../setup-notes.md">top-level documentation</a> if you can't use this script
            or if you prefer to download and unzip the dependencies by hand.</p>
         <p>For XProc runtime — to execute pipelines — use either of the scripts <a href="../../../xp3.sh">./xp3.sh</a>
            (under <code>bash</code>) or <a href="../../../xp3.bat">./xp3.bat</a> (for Windows). These scripts are used
            for all pipelines (basically, for everything) unless otherwise noted.</p>
         <p>To perform the setup: first, you download an XProc engine; then you complete setup and testing by running
            these pipelines. They are described in top-level <a href="../../../README.md">README</a> documentation and
            the expected places.</p>

         </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Step One: Setup</h2>
         <p>Find setup instructions for the repository in the <a href="../../../README.md">Project README</a> and in the
            linked <a href="../../../setup-notes.md">Setup Notes</a>.</p>
         <p>After reading and reviewing these documents, perform the setup on your system as instructed. To do this you
            can either fork or clone the repository in GitHub or simply download and decompress a zip of the <a
               href="https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-xproc3/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">current
            distribution</a>.</p>
         <p>After running the setup script, or performing the installation by hand, make sure you can run all the smoke
            tests successfully.</p>
         <p>As noted in the docs, if you happen already to have an XProc 3.0 processor, you do not need to download <a
               href="https://www.xml-project.com/morganaxproc-iiise.html">Morgana XProc III</a> here. At time of writing
            (December 2024) this notably includes <a href="https://github.com/xmlcalabash/xmlcalabash3">XML Calabash
               3</a> (newly out in an alpha release). In any case, equipped with <i>any conformant XProc 3.0/3.1
               implemenentation</i>. try skipping straight to the smoke tests. You can use a runtime script
               <code>xp3.sh</code> or <code>xp3.bat</code> as a model for your own, and adjust.</p>
         <section>
            <h3>Shortcut</h3>
            <p>If you want to run through the tutorial exercises but you are unsure of how deeply you will delve, you
               can postpone two of the installations until later:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>You will need XSpec only when you want to run tests of stylesheets or queries using the <a
                     href="https://github.com/xspec/xspec">XSpec</a> testing framework</li>
               <li>You will need SchXSLT only when you want to run Schematron (or XSpec tests of Schematron)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you see tracebacks suggesting one of these is not supported, you can return to setup.</p>
            <p>Since almost any pipeline will use XSLT and since we do use the latest version (XSLT 3.0 with XPath 3.1),
               consider the Saxon installation an essential requirement.</p>
         </section>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Step Two: Confirm</h2>
         <p>The top-level README and setup notes also describe testing your installation. Do this next.</p>
         <p>You know things are working in your XProc when two things are happening:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>On the console, notifications show up with reassuring messages announcing progress</li>
            <li>When you expect files to be produced for you, they appear, or are updated, as expected</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Both of those will occur with this lesson. The files produced by downloading pipelines are written into the
            project <code>lib</code> directory, as documented. Refresh or restore by deleting the downloaded files and
            running the pipelines to acquire them again.</p>
         <p>Note: you need a live Internet connection for your <code>http</code> requests to go through.</p>
         <p>When you can run all the smoke tests without ugly tracebacks, this lesson is complete.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Comments / review</h2>
         <p>Within this project as a whole, and within its subprojects, everything is done with XProc 3.0. The aim is to
            make it possible to do anything needed with XProc, regarded as a general-purpose 'scripting' solution for
            the choreography of arbitrarily complex jobs, tasks and workflows. To support arbitrary complexity and
            scalability together, it must be very simple. This simplicity, with the composability that goes with it, is
            at the center of the argument for XProc.</p>
         <p>You will see this simplicity at the level of <q>top-level</q>
            <em>invocation</em> XProc pipelines designed to serve as entry points. If things are done right, these will
            be fairly simple, well encapsulated <q>subroutines</q> in potentially elegant arrangements. They in turn may
            call on libraries of XProc pipelines for well-defined tasks.</p>
         <p>Effectively (and much more could be said about the processing stack, dependency management and so forth)
            what this means is that XProc promises the user and the developer (in either or both roles) with focused and
            concentrated points of control or points of adjustment. In the field – where software is deployed and used –
            things almost never just <q>drop in</q>. User interfaces, APIs, dependencies and platform quirks: all these
            constrain what users can do, and even developers are rarely as free as they would like to experiment and
            explore.</p>
         <p>What is offered here is therefore <i>both</i> an example of a deployment of a demonstration solution set
            using an open-source tool (an XProc engine capable of running the pipelines we offer), doing things that are
            actually or potential useful (with OSCAL data), <i>and</i> a set of pipelines that should in principle work
            as well in any other tool or software deployment supporting XProc 3.0.</p>
         <p>But to the extent this imposes a requirement for both abstract and testable conformance (or at any rate for
            interoperability as a proxy for that), this project only works if things are actually simple enough to pick
            up, use, learn and adapt. <code>xp3.sh</code> and <code>xp3.bat</code> represent attempts at making a simple
            deployment, easy to emulate but better yet, improve.</p>
         <p>Each of these scripts (on its execution platform) enables a user to run, without further configuration, the
               <a href="https://www.xml-project.com/morganaxproc-iiise.html">Morgana XProcIIIse</a> processor on any
            XProc 3.0 pipeline, assuming the appropriate platform for each (<code>bash</code> in the case of the shell
            script, Windows batch command syntax for the <code>bat</code> file). Providing a similar script for XML
            Calabash remains (with apologies to NDW) a <i>desideratum</i> for this project as we post this version of
            the tutorial. Stay tuned!</p>
         <p>In any case such a script itself must be <q>vanilla</q> and generic: it will simply invoke the processor
            with the designated pipeline, and stand back. (Yes, runtime arguments and settings can be provided.) The
            logic of operations is entirely encapsulated in the XProc pipeline designated. XProc 3.0 is both scalable
            and flexible enough to open a wide range of possibilities for data processing, both XML-based and using
            other formats such as JSON and plain text. It is the intent of this project not to explore and map this
            space – which is vast – but to show off enough XProc and related logic (XSLT, XSpec) to show how this
            exploration can be done. We are an outfitter at the beginning of what we hope will be many profitable
            voyages to places we have never been.</p>

            <h3>When running from a command line</h3>
            <p>As simple examples, these scripts show only one way of running XProc. Keep in mind that even simple
               scripts can be used in more than one way.</p>
            <p>For example, a pipeline can be executed from the project root:</p>
            <pre>$ ./xp3.sh smoketest/TEST-XPROC3.xpl</pre>
            <p>Alternatively, a pipeline can be executed from its home directory, for example if currently in the
                  <code>smoketest</code> directory (note the path to the script):</p>
            <pre>$ ../xp3.sh TEST-XPROC3.xpl</pre>
            <p>This works the same ways on Windows, with adjustments:</p>
            <pre>> ..\xp3 TEST-XPROC3.xpl </pre>
            <p>(On Windows a <code>bat</code> file suffix marks it as executable and does not have to be given
               explicitly when called.)</p>
            <p>Windows users (and others to varying degrees) can set up <a
                  href="https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-xproc3/discussions/18">a drag-and-drop based workflow</a> –
               using your mouse or pointer, select an XProc pipeline file and drag it to a shortcut for the executable
               (Windows batch file). A command window opens to show the operation of the pipeline. See the <a
                  href="../../README.md">README</a> for more information.</p>
            <p>It is important to try things out since any of these methods can be the basis of a workflow.</p>
            <p>For the big picture, keep in mind that while the command line is useful for development and demonstration
               – and however familiar XProc itself may become to the developer – to a great number of people it remains,
               like XProc, obscure, cryptic and intimidating if not forbidding.</p>
            <p>This is a pity because (among other reasons) the kind of layered system we will see and build here is not
               endless or infinitely complex. Begin by making yourself comfortable at the command line. See how the
               pieces fit together by working them.</p>
            <p>Then too, if you have something better, by all means use it. XProc-based systems, when integrated into
               tools or developer editors and environments, can look much nicer than tracebacks in a console window. The
               elegance and power we are trying to cultivate are at a deeper level. First and last, the focus must be on
               the data.</p>
