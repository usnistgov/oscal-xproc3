      <h1>102: Examining the setup</h1>
      <section><h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Look at some pipeline organization and syntax on the inside</li>
         <li>Success and failure invoking XProc pipelines: making friends with tracebacks</li>
      </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
         <p>Please complete the repository setup and smoke tests as described in the <a href="acquire_101_src.html"
               class="LessonUnit">101 lesson</a>. In this lesson, we will run these pipelines with adjustments, or
            similar pipelines.</p>
         <p>This discussion assumes basic knowledge of coding, the Internet (including retrieving resources via
               <code>file</code> and <code>http</code> protocols), and web-based technologies including HTML.</p>
         <p>XML knowledge is <i>not</i> assumed. This poses a special challenge since in addition to its XML-based
            syntax, XProc uses the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel/">XML Data Model (XDM)</a> along with
               <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/">XPath 3.1</a>, the query language for XML: together, a deep
            topic. We make the assumption that if you already know XML, XPath, XSLT or XQuery, much will be familiar,
            but you will be tolerant of some restatement for the sake of those who do not. (As we all start somewhere,
            why not here.)</p>
         <p>You will also need a programmer's plain text editor, XML/XSLT editor or IDE (integrated development
            environment) for more interactive testing of the code.</p>

         <h2>Step Zero: XProc steps</h2>
         <p>An XProc <em>pipeline</em> is composed out of XProc <em>steps</em>. Entire pipelines can then be called as
            steps in other pipelines. When you look at an XProc pipeline you will see an XML element named
               <code>p:declare-step</code> (modulo namespace prefix adjustments - it might be
               <code>xproc3:declare-step</code>), because conceptually, any pipeline is considered as a step in itself.
            Like a step, a pipeline works with defined inputs (<em>sources</em>) to deliver defined outputs
               (<em>results</em>). But any pipeline is also built out of steps – many of which are considered
               <em>atomic</em> or <q>primitive</q>, but some of which you might build yourself (as pipelines).</p>
         <p>XProc also exploits the idea of <q>pipelining</q> by offering features that allow you to connect steps
            together in arbitrary ways (pipeline logic can be complex), but also by falling back, when you make no such
            connections, to an easily-understood <q>chaining</q> model, in which each step consumes the output of its
            immediate predecessor. This makes it possible for simple pipelines to be very succinct: just put the steps
            in the order they are to be performed – while noting these are <i>logical</i> dependencies, with processors
            free to optimize where possible (for example, skipping steps whose results are never used) or as
            directed.</p>
         <p>One consequence is that the shorter and simpler a pipeline is, the more important it is to understand that a
            step can pick up inputs from the last step and pass them to the next, in the order given. As long as the
            designated default (or <em>implicit</em>) bindings for all required inputs and outputs can be discovered by
            the rules, everything runs.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
         <h2>Step One: Inspect the pipelines</h2>
         <p>The two groupings of pipelines used in setup and testing can be considered separately.</p>
         <p>The key to understanding both groups is to know that once the initial <a href="../../../setup.sh">Setup
               script</a> is run, your processor or <q>engine</q> (such as Morgana) can be invoked directly, as paths
            and scripts are already in place. In doing so – before extension libraries are in place – it can use only
            basic XProc steps, but those are enough to start with.</p>
         <p>Specifically, the pipelines can acquire resources from the Internet, save them locally, and perform
            unarchiving (or in this case unzipping, which combines unarchiving with data decompression). Having been
            downloaded, each library provides software that the pipeline engine (Morgana) can use to do more.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, the first group of pipelines (in the <a href="../../../lib/readme.md">lib</a> directory) has
            a single purpose, namely (together and separately) to download software to augment Morgana's feature
            set.</p>
         <p>If not using the open-source Morgana distribution, you can skip to smoke tests below, and see how far you
            get.</p>
            <ul>
               <li><a href="../../../lib/GRAB-SAXON.xpl">lib/GRAB-SAXON.xpl</a></li>
               <li><a href="../../../lib/GRAB-SCHXSLT.xpl">lib/GRAB-SCHXSLT.xpl</a></li>
               <li><a href="../../../lib/GRAB-XSPEC.xpl">lib/GRAB-XSPEC.xpl</a></li>
               </ul>
         <p>Pipelines in a second group work similarly in that each one exercises and tests capabilities provided by
            software downloaded by a member of the first group.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XPROC3.xpl">smoketest/TEST-XPROC3.xpl</a> tests the execution runtime
               (MorganaXProc-III or other engine)</li>
            <li><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XSLT.xpl">smoketest/TEST-XSLT.xpl</a> tests Saxon</li>
               <li><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-SCHEMATRON.xpl">smoketest/TEST-SCHEMATRON.xpl</a> tests SchXSLT
               (using <code>p:validate-with-schematron</code> step)</li>
               <li><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XSPEC.xpl">smoketest/TEST-XSPEC.xpl</a> tests XSpec (using locally
               defined steps)</li>
            </ul>
         <p>Take a look at these files. It may be helpful (for those getting used to it) to envision the XML syntax as a
            set of nested frames with labels and connectors.</p>
         <p>Try more than one way of looking at the XProc source code: in the Github repository, on your file system, in
            a plain text editor, in an XML editor.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Step Two: Modify the pipelines</h2>
         <p>Use a text editor or software development application for this exercise.</p>
         <p>If you have any concepts for improvements to the pipelines, or other resources that might be acquired this way, copy and modify one of the pipelines given to achieve those results.</p>
         <p>Even if not: be sure to break the pipelines given – or copies under new names – in any of several ways. Then
            run the modified pipelines, as a <i>safe way</i> to familiarize yourself with error messages:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Break the XML syntax of a pipeline and try to run it</li>
            <li>Leave XML syntax intact (well-formed), but break something in the XProc <ul>
                  <li>An element name, attribute or attribute setting</li>
                  <li>A namespace</li>
               </ul></li>
            <li>Try to retrieve something from a broken link</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Having introduced an error, reverse the damage. Make sure your pipelines are back in working order when this
            exercise is complete.</p>
      </section>

         <h2>For consideration</h2>
         <p>Developers coming to this technology need to consider who would use it, and whether it is useful mainly at
            the back end, or also <q>on the shop floor</q>, directly in the hands of professionals who must work with
            the data, bringing expertise in subject matter (such as, for OSCAL, systems security documentation) but not
            in data processing as such.</p>
         <p>Key to this question is not only whether attractive and capable user interfaces (or other mediators) can be
            developed (this is a known problem) but more importantly whether the systems themselves are adaptable enough
            so they can be deployed, used, refitted and maintained not just for repetitive generic tasks, but for
               <i>particular</i>, <i>special</i> and <i>local</i> problems, especially those discoverable only at the
            points where information is gathered and codified.</p>
         <p>This larger fitting of solutions to problems is a responsibility for both SMEs (subject matter experts) and
            software developers together, who must define problems to be solved before approaches to them can be
            found.</p>
         <p>The open questions are: who can use XProc pipelines; and how can they be made more useful? The questions
            come up in an OSCAL context or any context where XML is demonstrably capable, or indeed anywhere we find the
            necessity of handling data with digital tools has become inescapable.</p>
         <p>In order to help answer this question, actual experience will be invaluable – part of our motive here.
            Unless we can make the demonstration pipelines in this repository accessible, they cannot be reasoned about.
            That accessibility requires not only open publication, but also use cases and  user bases ready to take
            advantage.</p>
         <p>Having completed and tested the setup you are ready for work with XProc: proceed to the next lesson.</p>
