      <h1>599: Meeting XProc</h1>
      <section>
         <h2>Goals</h2>
         <p>Gain some more sense of context.</p>
         <p>XProc is not a simple thing, with only one way in. The territory is vast, but it has also been well charted.
            And here we have a pathway marked in front of us.</p>

         <h2>Resources</h2>
         <p><a href="https://markupdeclaration.org/resources/bibliography">A Declarative Markup Bibliography</a> is
            available on line for future reference on this interesting topic.</p>

         <h2>Some observations</h2>
         <p>Because it is now centered on <em>pipelines</em> built out of combining capabilities of <em>steps</em>
            (which may be black boxes), as much as on files and software packages, dependency management when using
            XProc is different from other technologies including Java and NodeJS – how so?</p>
         <p>MorganaXProc-III is implemented in Scala, and Saxon is built in Java, but otherwise distributions including
            the SchXSLT and XSpec distributions consist mainly of XSLT. This is either very good (with development and
            maintenance requirements in view), or not good at all.</p>
         <p>If not using Morgana but another XProc engine (at time of writing, XML Calabash 3 has been published in
            alpha), there will presumably be analogous arrangements: contracts between the tool and its dependencies,
            software or components and capabilities bundled and unbundled.</p>
         <p>So does this work well, on balance, and what are the determining variables that tell you XProc is a good fit
            for data processing, whether high touch, or at scale? How much of this is due to the high-level, abstracted
            nature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth-generation_programming_language">4GLs</a> including
            both XSLT 3.1 and XProc 3.0? Prior experience with XML-based systems and the problem domains in which they
            work well is probably a consideration. But maybe the more important blockers have to do with culture, states
            of knowledge, incorrect assumptions and outdated perceptions.</p>
         <p>Will it always be that a developer determined to use XSLT will find a way, whereas a developer determined
            not to, will find a way to refuse it? XProc in 2024 seems slow in adoption – maybe because everyone who
            would want it, already has a functional equivalent in place.</p>
         <p>In any case, it might also be that such neglect creates a market opportunity. Those who use these
            technologies without advertising the fact may have the most to gain. But building the commons is also a
            common responsibility.</p>
         <p>It's all about the tools.  Find ways to support your open-source developer and the software development
            operations who offer free tools and services.</p>

         <h2>Declarative markup in action</h2>
         <p>Considerable care is taken in developing these demonstrations to see to it that the technologies on which we
            depend, notably XProc and XSLT but not limited to these, are both nominally and actually conformant to
            externally specified standard technologies, i.e. XProc and XSLT respectively (as well as others), and
            reliant to the greatest possible extent on well-documented and accessible runtimes.</p>
         <p>Is it too much to expect that any code base should be both easy to integrate and use with others, and at the
            same time, functionally complete and self-sufficient? Of these two, we are lucky to get one, even if we are
            thoughtful enough to limit ourselves to building blocks. Because the world is complex, we are always
            throwing in one or another new dependency, along with new rule sets. The approach enabled by XML and
            openly-specified supporting specifications is to work by making everything transparent as possible. We seek
            for clarity and transparency at all levels (so nothing is downloaded behind the scenes, for example) while
            also documenting as thoroughly as we can, including with code comments.</p>
         <p>Can any code base be fully self-explanatory and self-disclosing? This may be doubtful even if we can agree
            what those terms mean. At the same time, the attempt can be made: we can try and leave tracks and markers,
            at least. We call it <q>code</q> with the hope and intent that it should be amenable to and rewarding of
            interpretation.</p>

            <p>In addition to the web itself (in HTML and CSS), a number of important initiatives in recent decades have
               capitalized on the core principles of declarative markup:</p>
