      <h1>101: Seeing valid OSCAL</h1>
      <section>
         <h2>Goals</h2>
         <p>Run pipelines that perform OSCAL schema validation, determining the conformance of your OSCAL files to the
            rules defined by an appropriate schema.</p>
         <p>See how these are wired up in XProc, along with a sense of the complexity, tradeoffs and possibilities.</p>
         <p>Gain some sense of wider issues related to schemas, schema evolution, data set regularity and
            predictability.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
         <p>You have succeeded in prior exercises, including tools installation and setup.</p>
         <p> You know what OSCAL is and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/resources/concepts/validation/">what
                  <q>validation</q> means</a> in the context of XML and data processing. You are aware of the existence
            of the OSCAL schemas to define syntax for its models in XML and in JSON.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Resources</h2>
         <p>This unit relies on the <a href="../../../projects/oscal-validate/readme.md">oscal-validate project</a> in
            this repository, with its files. Like other projects this one may have installation or setup pipelines to
            run.</p>
         <p>Additionally if you have your own OSCAL to bring, especially OSCAL catalogs, bring them along.</p>
         <p>Learners who are completely new to XML may find themselves in deep, quite soon. Then too, and in any case,
            without a problem of your own to solve, any demonstration here will be very abstract. Counter these problems
            with more resources:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Work closely with a partner who can bring the data</li>
            <li>Reach out via Github Discussions with questions</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>Step one: validate some OSCAL XML</h2>
         <p>The project contains pipelines that perform validation. Any description that appears here may go out of
            date, so check everything stated in the tutorial coverage against the actual files.</p>
         <section>
            <h3>Boldly coding</h3>
            <p>There are those who will look at a screen with a traceback with equanimity and dispassion - and those who
               will recoil. Maybe you are one of the fearless, maybe even one of the curious. Open the pipeline code in
               a programmer's text editor or IDE (integrated development environment) and get a sense of just how
               malleable it is.</p>
            <p>XML comment syntax takes the form of angle-bracketed text with dashes (hyphens) and a bang: <code>&lt;!–
                  --></code>. You will see comments throughout the code examples, sometimes as inline documentation, and
               sometimes for entire blocks of inactive code.</p>
            <p>The intrepid explorer will try both <i>tweaking</i>, around the edges, then <i>adapting</i>, with new
               ideas.</p>
            <p>The best of it is, as you learn how <b>a traceback is a tasty treat</b>, you enter a virtuous learning
               cycle. Repair a few bugs and you might get a taste for it. (Try the <a href="oscal-validate_102_src.html"

         <h2>Step two: validate and report</h2>
         <p>Schema validation is an automated process, but it is typically done not for its own sake, but rather as a
            preliminary to some other kind of processing, data analysis or manipulation. Accordingly a validator is
            frequently designed to be deployed silently - it only makes noise (emits errors or exceptions) if and as
            problems arise. Silence is good news when it comes to validators.</p>
         <p>However, we also have a step that instead of ending silently, reports summary results.</p>

            <h3>Optional: confirm the validation</h3>

         <h2>Step three: Run a batch validator</h2>

         <p>TODO Two ways: separate pipeline; and single pipeline; also a 'switcher' pipeline?</p>
         <p> Also see 102 for a pipeline to digest results of batch validation plus see field testing.</p>

         <h2>What could possibly go wrong?</h2>
         <p>As always, determining early whether a problem can be solved or mitigated at home, versus when it requires
            some kind of external intervention, is key.</p>
         <p>Fortunately many of the issues that can prevent validation processes from working are the same issues that
            prevent processing in general, and as such are recognizable from the same tracebacks.</p>
         <p>If you do not yet understand the critical distinction between syntactic correctness or
               <q>well-formedness</q>, and validity against the rules stipulated by a model, check out <a
               href="https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/resources/concepts/validation/">the OSCAL web site on that
            topic</a>.</p>
         <p>A syntax error will typically produce a similar or the same error in a validation process as it does in any
            process, inasmuch as a syntax error prevents any kind of processing to be conducted dependably (by a
            deterministic process). As usual in such cases, expect to see console tracebacks and error messages when
            things go wrong (resources are unavailable or out of order), but not process outputs, whether messages or
            files.</p>
         <p>For the same reason, this class of problems is usually found early in pipeline development. Once a pipeline
            is running with tools operating and configured properly, this problem goes away. A developer breaking new
            ground still must be able to recognize them.</p>
         <p>The more interesting class of problems is what are called <q>validation errors</q>, which somewhat
            confusingly represents that class of problems that result not from files that are syntactically erroneous
            and therefore cannot be read, but more subltly, in data instances that can be read, but that when read, are
            found to fail to conform to expectations, as expressed in an applicable rules set.</p>
         <p>Such a rules set is called a <q>schema</q> and deploying a schema to impose regularity and predictability
            over an open-ended body of data – including data that has not yet been created – is a primary responsibility
            of an entity that seeks to define an interoperable language, supporting robust data interchange across
            organizational boundaries.</p>

         <h2>What is this schema?</h2>
         <section>
            <h3>Schemas and document types</h3>
            <p>Schemas turn an open-world problem into a closed-world problem, giving it boundaries and helping to make
               it manageable. It traces the outline of the expected. Anything it does not account for can be considered
               out of consideration, other things being equal. As such it is an extremely useful <q>touchstone
                  process</q> (it might be called) that reveal early what kinds of risks there are, if any (and only if
               risks of wasted effort and resources), from processing inputs not fit, defective or <q>to spec</q>. There
               are many ways of designing and building information processing systems with and around schemas, and many
               types of schemas for specific technologies. Even within the relatively narrow context of XML, there are
               many schema validation technologies available, and many approaches to validation using different kinds of
               schemas or schemas in different ways.</p>
            <p>Even within this complexity, however, a certain regularity is accomplished by the most typical use case
               and application for a schema, broadly, namely to define and assert a <i>document type</i> for an instance
               or recognized entity evaluated by an XML processor. XML documents, that is to say, share many general
               characteristics (for example rules of syntax), while in other respects their differences are critical. In
               order that we can distinguish, for example, between a document as a <b>bill</b> (or invoice) and a
                  <b>receipt</b> (two things that may superficially look somewhat similar), we can distinguish between
               apparently small but critical distinctions that define and characterize them - the rules they follow.</p>
            <p>OSCAL deploys a range of models, each with its own schemas (for XML and JSON variants of the model). Each
               model describes a different OSCAL type.</p>

         <h2>Critique so far</h2>
         <p>At time of writing this tutorial is very rough, with very much extension and refinement remaining to be
            done.</p>
         <p>Tell us what we are doing right and wrong so far. Help us understand where things need to be explained, or
            better, illuminated by saying less - where is it too thick.</p>
