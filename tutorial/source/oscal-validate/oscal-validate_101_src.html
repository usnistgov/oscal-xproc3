      <h1>101: OSCAL from XML to JSON and back</h1>
      <section>
         <h2>Goals</h2>
         <p>Learn how OSCAL data can be converted between JSON and XML formats, using XProc.</p>
         <p>Learn something about potential problems and limitations when doing this, and about how to detect, avoid,
            prevent or mitigate them.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
         <p>You have succeeded in prior exercises, including tools installation and setup.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Resources</h2>
         <p>This unit relies on the <a href="../../../projects/oscal-validate/readme.md">oscal-validate project</a> in this
            repository, with its files.</p>

         <h2>Step two: validating sets of documents, handling outputs</h2>
         <p>TODO Two ways: separate pipeline; and single pipeline; also a 'switcher' pipeline?</p>
         <p> Also see 102 for a pipeline to digest results of batch validation plus see field testing.</p>

         <h2>What could possibly go wrong?</h2>
         <p>As always, determining early whether a problem can be solved or mitigated at home, versus when it requires
            some kind of external intervention, is key.</p>
         <p>Fortunately many of the data quality issues that can prevent validation processes from working are the same
            issues that prevent processing in general, and as such are recognizable from the same tracebacks.</p>
         <p>Creating a syntax error in a file to be validated, that is, should produce a similar or the same error in
            processing that you will see from trying to transform or convert that same file, or perform any processing,
            inasmuch as a syntax error prevents any kind of processing at all. Expect to see console tracebacks and
            error messages, but not process outputs (either messages or files).</p>
         <p>For the same reason, this class of problems are usually found early in pipeline development.</p>
         <p>The more interesting class of problems is what is called <q>validation errors</q>, which somewhat
            confusingly represents that class of problems that result not from files that are syntactically erroneous
            and therefore cannot be read, but more subltly, in data instances that can be read, but when read to not
            conform to an applicable rules set.</p>
         <p>Such a rules set is called a <q>schema</q> and deploying a schema to impose regularity and predictability
            over an open-ended body of data – including data that has not yet been created – is a primary responsibility
            of an entity that seeks to define an interoperable language, supporting robust data interchange across
            organizational boundaries.</p>
