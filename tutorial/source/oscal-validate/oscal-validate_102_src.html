      <h1>101: Validating OSCAL</h1>
      <section>
         <h2>Goals</h2>
         <p>Apply XProc for OSCAL schema validation, to determine the conformance of your OSCAL files to the rules
            defined by an appropriate schema.</p>
         <p>Gain some sense of wider issues related to schemas, schema evolution, data set regularity and
            predictability.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
         <p>You have succeeded in prior exercises, including tools installation and setup.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Resources</h2>
         <p>This unit relies on the <a href="../../../projects/oscal-validate/readme.md">oscal-validate project</a> in
            this repository, with its files. Like other projects this one may have installation or setup pipelines to
            run.</p>

         <h2>Step one: validate some OSCAL XML</h2>

      <section>
         <h2>Step two: validating sets of documents, handling outputs</h2>
         <p>TODO Two ways: separate pipeline; and single pipeline; also a 'switcher' pipeline?</p>
         <p> Also see 102 for a pipeline to digest results of batch validation plus see field testing.</p>
