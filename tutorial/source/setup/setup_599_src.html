      <h1>599: Meeting XProc</h1>
      <section>
         <h2>Some observations</h2>
         <p>Because it is now centered on <i>pipelines</i> as much as on software packages, dependency management is
            different from other technologies including Java and NodeJS - how so?</p>
         <p>MorganaXProc-III is implemented in Scala, and Saxon is built in Java, but otherwise distributions including
            the SchXSLT and XSpec distributions consist mainly of XSLT. This is either very good (with development and
            maintenance requirements in view), or not good at all.</p>
         <p>How much of this is due to the high-level, abstracted nature of <a
               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth-generation_programming_language">4GLs</a> including both XSLT
            3.1 and XProc 3.0?</p>
