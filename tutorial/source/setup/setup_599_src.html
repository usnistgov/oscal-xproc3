      <h1>XProc 599: Project setup and installation</h1>
      <h2>Some observations</h2>
      <p>Because it is now centered on <i>pipelines</i> as much as on software packages, dependency management is
         different from other technologies including Java and  NodeJS - how so?</p>
      <p>MorganaXProc-III is implemented in Scala, and Saxon is built in Java, but otherwise distributions including the SchXSLT and XSpec distributions consist mainly of XSLT. This is either very good (with development and maintenance requirements in view), or not good at all.</p>
      <p>How much of this is due to the high-level, abstracted nature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth-generation_programming_language">4GLs</a> including both XSLT 3.1 and XProc 3.0?</p>
