      <h1>101: Project setup and installation</h1>
      <section>
         <h2>Goals</h2>
         <p>Run an XProc 3.0 pipeline in an XProc 3.0 engine. See the results.</p>
         <p>With a little practice, become comfortable running XProc pipelines, seeing results on a console (command
            line) window as well as in the file system.</p>
         <p>After the first script to get the XProc engine, we use XProc for subsequent downloads. Finishing the setup
            gets you started practicing with the pipelines.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
         <p>You have Java installed with a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) available on the command line (a JRE or JDK),
            version 8 (and later).</p>
         <p>You have a live Internet connection and the capability to download and save resources (binaries and code
            libraries) for local use.</p>
         <p><b>Tip:</b> check your Java version from the console using <code>java --version</code>.</p>
         <p>You are comfortable entering commands on the command line. For installation, you want a <code>bash</code>
            shell if available. On Windows, both WSL (Ubuntu) and Git Bash have been found to work. If you cannot use
               <code>bash</code>, the setup can be done by hand (downloading and unpacking a package from
            SourceForge).</p>
         <p>After installation, subsequent work on Windows does not require <code>bash</code> unless you choose to use
            it – a Windows <code>CMD</code> or Powershell can serve as your environment and the processor invoked with a
            Windows <code>bat</code> file (as described in the documentation). Mac and Linux (and WSL) users can
            continue to use <code>bash</code>.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Resources</h2>
         <p>The setup script is a <code>bash</code> script: <a href="../../../setup.sh">./setup.sh</a>, to be run with no arguments.</p>
         <p>For XProc runtime — to execute pipelines — use either of the scripts <a href="../../../xp3.sh">./xp3.sh</a> (under <code>bash</code>) or <a href="../../../xp3.bat">./xp3.bat</a> (for Windows). These scripts are
            used for all pipelines (basically, for everything) unless otherwise noted.</p>
         <p>The following pipelines will be run. They are described in top-level <a href="../../../README.md">README</a> documentation and the expected places.</p>
         <ul>
            <li><a href="../../../lib/GRAB-SAXON.xpl">lib/GRAB-SAXON.xpl</a></li>
            <li><a href="../../../lib/GRAB-SCHXSLT.xpl">lib/GRAB-SCHXSLT.xpl</a></li>
            <li><a href="../../../lib/GRAB-XSPEC.xpl">lib/GRAB-XSPEC.xpl</a></li>
            <li><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XPROC3.xpl">smoketest/TEST-XPROC3.xpl</a></li>
            <li><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XSLT.xpl">smoketest/TEST-XSLT.xpl</a></li>
            <li><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-SCHEMATRON.xpl">smoketest/TEST-SCHEMATRON.xpl</a></li>
            <li><a href="../../../smoketest/TEST-XSPEC.xpl">smoketest/TEST-XSPEC.xpl</a></li>
         </ul>
      </section>
         <section>
            <h2>Step One: Setup</h2>
            <p>Find setup instructions for the repository in the <a href="../../../README.md">Project README</a> and in the linked <a href="../../../setup-notes.md">Setup Notes</a>.</p>
            <p>After reading and reviewing these documents, perform the setup as instructed. To do this you can either
            fork or clone the repository in GitHub or simply download and decompress a zip of the <a
               href="https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-xproc3/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">current
            distribution</a>.</p>
         <p>After running the setup script, or performing the installation by hand, make sure you can run all the smoke
            tests successfully.</p>
         <p>As noted in the docs, if you happen already to have <a
               href="https://www.xml-project.com/morganaxproc-iiise.html">Morgana XProc III</a>, you do not need to
            download it again. Try skipping straight to the smoke tests. (You can use a runtime script
               <code>xp3.sh</code> or <code>xp3.bat</code> as a model for your own, and adjust. Any reasonably recent
            version of Morgana should function if configured correctly, and we are interested if it does not.) </p>
         <section>
            <h3>Shortcut</h3>
            <p>If you want to run through the tutorial exercises but you are unsure of how deeply you will delve, you
               can postpone two of the installations until later:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>You will need XSpec only when you want to run tests of stylesheets or queries using the <a href="https://github.com/xspec/xspec">XSpec</a> testing framework</li>
               <li>You will need SchXSLT only when you want to run Schematron (or XSpec tests of Schematron)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you see tracebacks suggesting one of these is not supported, you can return to setup.</p>
            <p>Since almost any pipeline will use XSLT and since we do use the latest version (XSLT 3.0 with XPath 3.1), consider
               the Saxon installation an essential requirement.</p>
         </section>
         </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Step Two: Confirm</h2>
         <p>The top-level README and setup notes also describe testing your installation. Do this next.</p>
         <p>You know things are working in your XProc when either or both of two things are happening:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>On the console, notifications show up with reassuring messages announcing progress</li>
            <li>When you expect files to be produced, they appear, or are updated, as expected</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Both of those will occur with this lesson. The files produced by downloading scripts are written into the
            project <code>lib</code> directory, as documented. Refresh or restore by deleting the downloaded files and
            running the pipelines to acquire them again.</p>
         <p>Note: you need a live Internet connection for your http requests to go through.</p>
         <p>When you can run all the smoke tests without ugly tracebacks, this lesson is complete.</p>

         <h2>Comments / review</h2>
         <p>Within this project as a whole, and within its subprojects, everything is done with XProc 3.0, meaning
            everything can be done using a single script, which invokes an XProc processor to read and execute a
            pipeline. This simplicity is at the center of the argument for XProc. The counter argument is that the world
            is never like that. This project is based on the premise that a lab environment can be useful even for
            studying things more commonly encountered in the real world.</p>
         <p>Effectively (and much more could be said about the processing stack, dependency management and so forth)
            what this means is that XProc offers the user and the developer (in either or both roles) with focused and
            concentrated points of control or points of adjustment. In the field -- where software is deployed and
            used -- things almost never just <q>drop in</q>. User interfaces, APIs, dependencies and platform quirks: all these 
            constrain what users can do, and even developers are rarely free to just mess around, as it might be thought of.</p>
         <p>To the extent this is the case, this project only works if things are actually simple enough to pick up,
            use, learn and adapt.</p>
         <p><code>xp3.sh</code> and <code>xp3.bat</code> represent attempts at this. Each of them (on its execution
            platform) enables a user to run, without further configuration, the <a
               href="https://www.xml-project.com/morganaxproc-iiise.html">Morgana XProcIIIse</a> processor on any XProc
            3.0 pipeline, assuming the appropriate platform for each (<code>bash</code> in the case of the shell script,
            Windows batch command syntax for the <code>bat</code> file). Other platforms supporting Java (and hence
            Morgana with its libraries) could be provided with similar scripts.</p>
         <p>Such a script itself must be <q>vanilla</q> and generic: it simply invokes the processor with the designated
            pipeline, and stands back. The logic of operations is entirely encapsulated in the XProc pipeline
            designated. XProc 3.0 is both scalable and flexible enough to open a wide range of possibilities for data
            processing, both XML-based and using other formats such as JSON and plain text. It is the intent of this
            project not to explore and map this space – which is vast – but to show off enough XProc and related logic
            (XSLT, XSpec) to show how this exploration can be done. We are an outfitter at the beginning of what
            we hope will be a long and profitable voyage.</p>
         <section>
            <h3>Tweaks</h3>
            <p>As simple examples, these scripts show only one way of running XProc. Keep in mind that even simple
               scripts can be used in more than one way. </p>
            <p>For example, a pipeline can be executed from the project root:</p>
            <pre>$ ./xp3.sh smoketest/TEST-XPROC3.xpl</pre>
            <p>Alternatively, a pipeline can be executed from its home directory, for example if currently in the
                  <code>smoketest</code> directory (note the path to the script): </p>
            <pre>$ ../xp3.sh TEST-XPROC3.xpl</pre>
            <p>This works the same ways on Windows, with adjustments: </p>
            <pre>> ..\xp3 TEST-XPROC3.xpl </pre>
            <p>(On Windows a <code>bat</code> file suffix marks it as executable and does not have to be given
               explicitly when calling.)</p>
            <p>Windows users (and others to varying degrees) can set up a drag-and-drop based workflow - using your
               mouse or pointer, select an XProc pipeline file and drag it to a shortcut for the executable (Windows
               batch file). A command window opens to show the operation of the pipeline. See the <a
                  href="../../README.md">README</a> for more information.</p>
            <p>It is important to try things out since any of these methods can be the basis of a workflow. </p>
            <p>For the big picture, keep in mind that while the command line is useful for development and demonstration
               – and however familiar XProc itself may become to the developer – to the uninitiated it remains obscure
               and cryptic. XProc-based systems, when integrated into tools or developer editors and environments, can
               look much nicer than tracebacks in a console window. The beauty we are looking for here is in a different
               kind of elegance and power.</p>
