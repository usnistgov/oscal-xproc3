      <h1>102: Examining the setup</h1>
      <p></p>
      <section><h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>You get to look at some pipeline organization and syntax on the inside</li>
         <li>You get some experience with success and failure invoking XProc pipelines. An early chance to learn to die
               fast and well.</li>
      </ul>
      </section>
      <section><h2>Resources</h2>
         <p>Same as <a href="setup_101_src.html">Setup 101</a>.</p>
      </section>
      <section><h2>Prerequisites</h2>
      <p>Please complete the repository setup and smoke tests as described in the <a href="setup_101_src.html">101 lesson</a>. In this lesson, we will run these pipelines with adjustments, or similar pipelines.</p>
         <p>This discussion assumes basic knowledge of coding, the Internet (including retrieving resources via <code>file</code> and <code>http</code> protocols, and web-based technologies including HTML.</p>
         <p>XML knowledge is also assumed, while at the same time we are interested to know where this gap needs to be filled.</p>
         <p>You will also need a programmer's plain text editor, XML/XSLT editor or IDE (integrated development
            environment) for more interactive testing of the code.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
         <h2>Step One: Inspect the pipelines</h2>
         <p>The two groupings of pipelines used in setup and testing should be discussed separately.</p>
         <p>The key to understanding both groups is to know that one the initial <a href="../../setup.sh">Setup script</a> is run, Morgana can be invoked directly, as paths and scripts are already in place. In doing so it can use only basic XProc steps, but those are enough for these purposes.</p>
         <p>Specifically, the pipelines can acquire resources from the Internet, save them locally, and perform unarchiving (unzipping). In this case, the downloaded resources provide software that the pipeline engine (Morgana) can use to do more.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, the first group of pipelines (in the <a href="../lib/">lib</a> directory has a single purpose, namely (together and separately) to download software for Morgana.</p>
            <ul>
               <li><a href="../../lib/GRAB-SAXON.xpl">lib/GRAB-SAXON.xpl</a></li>
               <li><a href="../../lib/GRAB-SCHXSLT.xpl">lib/GRAB-SCHXSLT.xpl</a></li>
               <li><a href="../../lib/GRAB-XSPEC.xpl">lib/GRAB-XSPEC.xpl</a></li>
               </ul>
         <p>The second group of pipelines also has a single purpose, namely to exercise and test the capabilities provided by the software downloaded by the first group.</p>
            <ul>
               <li><a href="../../smoketest/SMOKETEST-XSLT.xpl">smoketest/SMOKETEST-XSLT.xpl</a> tests Saxon</li>
               <li><a href="../../smoketest/SMOKETEST-SCHEMATRON.xpl">smoketest/SMOKETEST-SCHEMATRON.xpl</a> tests SchXSLT</li>
               <li><a href="../../smoketest/SMOKETEST-XSPEC.xpl">smoketest/SMOKETEST-XSPEC.xpl</a> tests XSpec</li>
            </ul>
         <p>Take a look at these. If it is helpful, try visualize the XML syntax as a set of nested frames with labels
            and connectors.</p>
         <p>Try more than one way of looking at the XProc source code: in the Github repository, on your file system, in
            a plain text editor, in an XML editor.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>Step Two: Modify the pipelines</h2>
         <p>Use a text editor or IDE for this exercise.</p>
         <p>If you have any concepts for improvements to the pipelines, or other resources that might be acquired this way, copy and modify one of the pipelines given to achieve those results.</p>
         <p>Even if not - be sure to break the pipelines given -- or of copies under new names -- in any of several
            ways. Then run the modified pipelines, as a <i>safe way</i> to familiarize yourself with error messages:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Break the XML syntax of a pipeline and try to run it</li>
            <li>Leave XML syntax intact (well-formed), but break something in the XProc
            <ul><li>An element name, attribute or attribute setting</li><li>A namespace</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Try to retrieve something from a broken link</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Make sure that pipelines are back in working order when this exercise is complete.</p>

         <h2>For consideration</h2>
         <p>Developers coming to this technology need to consider who would use it, and whether it is useful mainly at
            the back end, or also directly in the hands of professionals who must work with the data, bringing expertise
            in subject matter (such as, for OSCAL, systems security documentation) but not in data processing as
            such.</p>
         <p>Key to this question is not only whether attractive and capable user interfaces (or other mediators) can be
            developed (this is a known problem) but more importantly whether the systems themselves are adaptable enough
            so they can be deployed, used, refitted and maintained not just for repetitive generic tasks, but for
               <i>particular</i>, <i>special</i> and <i>local</i> problems discovered only at the points where
            information is gathered and codified.</p>
         <p>This larger fitting of solutions to problems is a responsibility for both CMEs (content matter experts) and
            developers together, who must define problems to be solved before approaches to them can be found.</p>
         <p>The open questions are: who can use XProc pipelines; and how can they be made more useful? The questions
            come up in an OSCAL context or any context where XML is demonstrably capable.</p>
