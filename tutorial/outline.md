# OSCAL in XProc - tutorial

## Goals

Capability to download and run XProc pipelines to perform useful applications for OSCAL, the Open Security Controls Assessment Language.

Foundation for further work with XML and XSLT.

Understanding of the current state of the art with respect to XML technologies, especially within the OSCAL and systems security context, and including any identified limitations (if any).

## Course Prerequisites

- Comfortable installing and running tools from the command line (Linux or Windows)
- Familiar with XML on at least one platform, or ready to learn
- Comfortable with Github (cloning or forking repositories)
- Have Java (v8/11) installed and working

## Sketch

This tutorial is designed to offer a self-guided tour for those unable to get live help. By following instructions carefully (and assuming requisite background), you should be able to make things work, understand the moving parts, and determine what to research next.

However, the resources offered are also intended to be available for discussion, whether in formal or informal training sessions among professionals, academics or amateur/freelancers. In development, we will be keeping the solo autodidact in mind -- but we also take note when we see opportunities for discussion and consideration of differing perspectives.

Not only is there no rule against 'borrowing' from or adapting this tutorial or part of it -- that is part of the idea. (Credit your sources as always.)

As noted in the readme, there are several ways to work the sequence.

Even the most casual readers will benefit from doing the **101** sequence exercises, which require no coding, just operation of the tools.

### Lesson sequence

Currently planned. The sequence is not final and not everything may be in it. While lessons build from one to the next they are designed for a certain degree of mix-and-match.

- setup
- unpack (survey of files used in setup)
- oscal-convert
- oscal-validate
- oscal-transform
- oscal-publish
- metaschema-analysis
- xproc-files (including zipping)
- xproc-document - covering xproc-doc
- xproc-validate - covering Schematron
- xproc-repo - ci/cd, regression testing
- xproc-xspec
- xproc-debug
- tutorial-publish

### Equipment

Command line with bash or Windows (cmd/Powershell)

File system browser i.e. Windows Explorer or Linux desktop
  - or you are awesome with the CL!
  
Programmer's text editor for light editing
  XML capabilities are awesome but not essential
